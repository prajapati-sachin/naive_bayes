Perfect
on
off
hrs
like
all
gyms
Staff
isnt
too
helpful...they
like
to
just
hang
out
vs
actually
cleaning
the
place
Some
equip
has
loose
handles
stair
climber
and
not
been
tighten
in
weeks
I
feel
i
should
bring
a
screw
driver
do
it
It
does
job
location
is
key
Just
wish
they
knew
how
be
clean
wouldnt
tan
there
based
clean
gym
Awesome
I
leave
rare
reviews
only
on
off
the

places
This
place
is
nice
Passed
it

Soft

and
interesting

NO
meat
items
here
and
I'm
an
lover
Ordered
Sambusk

YUM
My
friend
ordered
Shukshuka
Wow
everything
has
that
powerful
flavor
you
expect
from
Mediterranean
style
Open

yah
Lots
of
lite
things
to
choose
just
close
appetite
I
went
to
the
Boulevard
Mall
today
for
first
time
The
place
ain't
bad
Everyone
says
that
Eastside
is
bad
part
of
town
but
had
no
problems
wear
Issey
Miyake
and
it's
kind
hard
find
exact
cologne
wear
Macy's
waited
a
couple
minutes
didn't
get
any
service
After
noticing
workers
were
just
slacking
off
ignoring
me
decided
deserve
my
business
they
could
f*ck
off
While
was
leaving
mall
saw
Luxury
Perfumes
noticed
about
every
type
Miyake
cologne
girl
working
there
real
friendly
out
her
way
looking
for
She
literally
sprayed
me
head
toe
with
over
10
different
variations
Miyake
Eventually
we
found
one
it
only
cost
63.00
Stuff
from
Japan
usually
far
more
expensive
than
that
I'm
gonna
give
this
5-stars
all
on
account
fact
here
works
so
make
sure
customer

satisfied
That
work
ethic
rare
these
days
especially
in
LV
Came
here
for
the
Holiday
Lights
Train
Rides
around
Christmas
time
I
was
pleasantly
surprised
that
it
free
when
we
got
there
and
they
happily
take
donations
For
mainly
running
on
donations
lights
set
up
lovely
Although
busy
parking
not
an
issue
wait
maybe
5
minutes
The
ride
itself
20-30
Very
much
worth
it

This
is
one
of
our
regular
restaurants
And
judging
from
the
crowd
waiting
to
get
in
others
feel
same
We
ordered
pork
stomach
soup

was
soft
and
didn't
have
an
offal
flavor
broth
has
a
very
nice
savory
peppery
taste
excellent
you
should
try
it
especially
if
never
had

before
wide

she

Was
funny
when

came
out
and
there
only
1
shrimp
on
the
plate
not
sure
how
that
made
it
to
us
like
I
have
admit
funny
Waiter
quickly
fixed
brought
rest
of
shrimp
haha
still
makes
me
laugh
thinking

it
a
little

hey

Definitely
place
to

is
a

you
wait

literally
took

to

me
30
second

quote
that
I
scheduled
They
snail

and
email
stating
they
want
my

back
because
it's
in
high

then

2000
it
wow
just
wow
Purchased
from

14,000
last

WOW
REALLY
apparently
Toyota
depreciation
some
serious
business
The
gym
itself
is
really
nice
sales
team
a
bit
to
pushy
for
me
Went
in
try
it
out
and
within
8
hours
they
were
calling
asking
about
membership
Not
my
cup
of
tea
The
entire
staff
were
welcoming
and
social
it
was
a
great
spot
to
grab
quick
bite
socialize
chill
with
good
music
attentive
staff
I've
been
here
several
times
now
and
always
love
to
go
back
The
pizza
is
excellent
especially
if
you
like
the
artisan-ish
type
without
grease
puddles
with
fresh
ingredients
I
know
some
people
have
negatively
reviewed
here
but
thoroughly
disagree
that
beer
selection
great
dozens
of
craft
beers
on
draft
Create
a
sampler
there
It's
good
value
regards
amount
environment
nice
feel
comfortable
our
waiters
great
This
was
my
second
time
coming
to
this
place
I
will
admit
the
waitress
very
strange
She
did
stand
next
me
while
looked
at
menu
but
told
her
needed
more
and
she
actually
left
kind
when
paid
didn't
really
mind
awkwardness
Now
for
food
When
first
went
there
ordered
korean
ginseng
tea
kimchi
which
perfectly
fine
Not
below
average
not
amazing
should
also
mention
that
wasn't
went
The
man
who
served
seemed
be
owner
as
well
cook
or
one
of
them
perhaps
He
nice
had
a
HOT
cup
tea
asked
him
several
questions
about
he
answered
natto
bibimbap
no
idea
what
expect
just
wanted
something
weird
healthy
presented
with
four
cute
side
dishes
miso
soup
some
pink
stuff
might
have
been
cabbage
beets
lotus
root
cucumbers
seaweed
liked
every
those
dishes
It
so
they
all
strong
wonderful
flavours
Then
bibimbap
arrived
it
like
rainbow
in
bowl
don't
even
know
half
vegetables
were
cool
use
vegetables
came
little
dish
brown
rice
mixed
bean
I'm
going
lie
is
absolutely
disgusting
But
able
eat
rice
mushrooms
awesome
other
unknown
veggies
cool
tasting
crispy
raw
vegan
Honestly
think
it's
pretty
straightforward
knowing
whether
certain
items
are
vegan
or
not
Overall

frequent
customer
at
this
place
Reason
1
is
that
I
live
like
mile
away
and
reason
2
they
are
always
very
friendly
make
me
feel
welcome
Quality
of
work
great
take
their
time
Even
if
only
getting
polish
change
massage
lotion
my
hands
Also
really
have
been
trying
to
improve
the
place
with
new
spa
chairs
furniture
remember
went
there
once
before
owners
got
it
was
dusty
dirty
inside
But
management
has
turned
nice
clean
Place
is
friendly
service
good
food
ok
but
possibly
i
didn't
order
the
right
meal
for
me
It's
definitely
an
upgrade
of
regular
hot
dog
and
poutine
diner
A
little
more
expensive
than
expected
Overall
it
was
good
My
wife
and
I
decided
to
check
this
place
out
even
though
a
couple
friends
of
ours
said
it
was
overrated
The
seafood
we
got
actually
very
good
in
fact
the
scallop
appetizer
were
possibly
best
I've
ever
had
would
have
loved
get
more
than
3
quarter
sized
pieces
for
19
dollars
spent
At
least
make
4
so
can
split
meal
properly
should
stuck
with
but
sucked
into
one
their
daily
specials
some
10
day
dry
aged
delmonico
ultra
5000
steak

no
idea
man
rambled
on
20
minutes
describing
it
To
try
be
realistic
imagine
getting
an
80
at
restaurant
tastes
worse
what
you
home
hell
longhorns
steak
It
ordered
medium
rare
came
well
had
such
bad
burn
outer
side
like
hockey
puck
wife's
filet
tough
as
well
That
65
point
is
when

far
from
2.5
stars
This
was
our
first
time
at
Mijana
any
Lebanese
restaurant
actually
All
four
of
us
ordered
different
appetizers
meals
drinks
and
desserts
Every
single
item
delicious
Our
server
had
a
sense
humor
proven
when
I
an
alcoholic
drink
Figs

Kisses
she
said
We
don't
sell
alcohol
until
5
must
have
looked
either
startled
or
dumb
founded
because
started
grinning
knew
then
we
were
going
to
like
Mijana
Some
items
on
table
cheese

appetizer
zatar

Awesome
selection
of
all

Nice
indoor
showroom
Sales
people
were
nice
and
not
overly
pushy
Kudos
I
was
happy
that
we
able
to
try
the
sleeping
arrangements
since
my
husband
is
a
tall
man
Most
showers
he
can't
even
stand
in
This
made
it
easier
decide
what
camper
would
work
best
for
us
Now
challenging
part
money
Came
here
in
a
busy
Friday
night
and
waited
to
be
seated
for
25
mins
Ambiance
is
not
that
great
but
we
came
there
chow
so
didn't
care
about
it
much
Food
was
excellent
service
wait
long
our
food
served
We
ordered
shishito
peppers
angus
beef
tataki
spicy
soft
shell
crab
roll
some
white
wine
matcha
tiramisu
green
tea
cream
brûlée
Everything
tastes
sooo
good
except
the
brûlée
which
tasted
milky
But
overall
very
experience
will
recommend
them
everyone
was
gonna
give
an
easy
4
star
at
least
but
my
last
experience
here
sucks
I
ordered
california
burrito
chicken
torta
and
a
horchata
w/o
ice
after
paid
noticed
that
the

over
counter
who
wasn't
smiling
all
CHEWING

Not

sloooow
asking
3
times
if

waited
30
minutes

what

they
did
Another

gave
6
bucks
back
apologized
sincerely

these
kind
of

a

The

My

Mike
worked
quickly
with
me
on
a
Sunday
Nonetheless
He
was
very
friendly
and
wouldnt
even
charge
you
if
he
cant
fix
it
unlike
other
shops
We
went
on
Saturday
morning
table
of
5
waited
maybe
8
minutes
amazing
My
kids
were
taking
forever
and
I
thought
we
would
be
waiting
forever
Nicely
done
FT
Our
waitress
was
really
nice
came
right
over
to
us
All
the
waiters
stopped
at
our
see
how
doing
ate
stuffed
French
toast
ohhhh
man
So
good
The
toast
warm
soft
perfectly
cooked
cream

too
there
wasn't
a
lot
inside
but
man
it
good
only
negative
not
so
bad
check
wrong
said
something
fixed
quickly
Absolutely
HORRIBLE
food
and
not-so-great
service
either
This
place
had
the
worst
meat
quality
flavor
of
any
Brazilian
I've
been

I
thought
eaten
some
bad
until
came
in
here
The
sirloin
tri-tip
was
so
tough
completely
devoid
flavor
house
looked
promising
but
failed
every
way
very
tough
chewy
bland
quickly
gave
up
after
a
few
samples
meats
cut
my
losses
paid
check
If
you've
at
halfway
decent
chain
like
Fogo
de
Chao
or
Texas
Brazil
then
you
will
be
disappointed
with
this
place
Locals
casino
The
number
of
pools
is
odd
Did
win
fifty
bucks
Original
performance
was
the
best
Years
later
my
wife
and
I
brought
our
children
big
let
down
It
is
just
like
all
other
shows
by
their
company
Only
reason
gave
it
3
stars
because
of
actual
acts
The
original
amazing
There
a
scene
in
where
two
brothers
were
being
chased
up
mountain
while
fire
arrows
shot
at
them
Then
they
got
to
top
mountain
without
anywhere
else
go
jumped
off
into
sea
What...where
did
water
come
from
actually
dove
sea
water
When
your
eyes
focused
on
them
water
sudden
ship
appears
huge
seemed
appear
out
nowhere
that
what
like

Definitely
a
tasty
burger
Not
amazing
by
any
means
but
it
was
enjoyable
They
give
you
pencil
with
the
menu
and
fill
out
what
want
penciling
in
little
circles
I
thought
this
pretty
neat
The
burger
juicy
bleu
cheese
had
good
amount
of
flavor
also
liked
fries
would
absolutely
go
back
for
happy
hour
Walked
in
here
for
a
quick
lunch
I
was
little
surprised
to
see
that
Toma
seemed
like
nice
sit
down
restaurant
although
it
is
still
burger
joint
Sort
of
reminded
me
W
Burger
Bar
but
quieter
one
2
tables
being
occupied
so
service
quick
and
just
ordered
The
Classic
with
added
mushrooms
have
say
an
amazing
meal
worried
my
lack
side
order
would
leave
wanting
at
the
end
filled
up
fine
They
they
make
bun
fresh
daily
adds
much
overall
experience
rarely
indulge
red
meat
anymore
I'm
glad
this
foray
back
didn't
too
regret
thanks
wonderful
don't
really
else
other
than
simple
tasty
meal
big
mess
while
munching
on
it
do
get
feeling
5
star
experience
mainly
because
took
by
surprise
how
good
especially
considering
hadn't
heard
toma
prior
wandering
here
Not
sure
if
I'd
want
go
20
or
25
their
higher
offerings
since

Very
clean
friendly
staff
and
great
food
My
son
likes
those
crunchy
sticks
that
they
serve
with
the
soup
so
much
I
asked
for
a
to
go
bag
small
left
over
he
had....Instead
gave
us
huge
filled
sticks
Thank
you
guys
We
have
been
going
to
this
bar
for
about
15
years
since
it
was
The
Hargrave
menu
isn't
that
big
but
the
food
is
decent
and
service
usually
good
Unfortunately
ended
on
Saturday
night
A
waitress
he
haven't
seen
before
took
over
we
never
had
again
Our
drinks
were
empty
menus
placed
side
show
ready
nothing
then
got
pretty
busy
she
didn't
seem
up
task
I
tried
get
her
attention
nowhere
finally
bill
one
beer
from
guy
in
kitchen
who
came
out
bar
Needless
say
tip
zero
Not
sure
we'll
be
back
I
noticed
luscious
desserts
passing
by
and
decided
to
give
it
a
try
They
are
still
doing
their
soft
opening
not
sure
when
the
grand
opening
will
be
We
got
seated
right
away
on
Friday
evening
was
offered
water
ordered
two
items
Black
glutinous

definitely
come
again
try
other
items
good
food
salmon
is
fantastic
pricing
reasonable
and
staff

The
atmosphere

Being

I'm
glad

I
like
their
sesame

Pretty
simple
Their
dark
roast
Melvyn's
blend
coffee
nice
and
it's
charred
some
coffee
The

a

difficult
into
out
of
however
if
you're
at
right
time
morning
you
can
with
ease
Service
simple
people
friendly
restaurant
very
clean
Always
go
double
toasted

bagels
Not
your
average
Chinese
food
restaurant
This
is
an
authentic
experience
The
flavors
and
items
on
the
menus
are
very
different
broccoli
string
beans
awesome
I
also
enjoyed
BBQ
beef
I'm
a
keto
diet
so
didn't
get
to
try
noodles
I
came
here
with
my
family
for
lunch
yesterday
This
was
first
time
visiting
the
restaurant
it's
located
in
new
Kennedy
plaza
FYI
We
ordered
5
dishes
they
were
seafood
congee
eggplant
turnip
cakes
a
noodle
dish
and
chicken
it
recommended
on
our
place
mats
enjoyed
didn't
find
it
too
watery
cakes
were
really
good
much
bigger
comparison
to
if
you
go
one
of
congee
queen/king
franchises
Eggplant
dish
average
but
found
be
bit
salty..I
only
had
piece
Oh
also
HK
milk
tea..nothing
amazing
There
are
so
many
other
restaurants
that
don't
know
I'll
return
But
worth
try
They
have
service
bell
Well
not
bell..just
some
buttons
press
want
service
try
though
thought
it'd
better
we
just
call
server
ourselves
A
coworker
recommended
this
place

I
had
to
try
it
the
Oxtail
Chili
Cheese
Fries
which
were
interesting
It's
not
too
salty
it
a
sweetness
was
different
but
bad
at
all
It
can
get
pretty
packed
fast
so
keep
that
in
mind
Service
friendly
would
def
recommend
people
Place
is
nice
there
plenty
of
staff
and
it's
not
too
busy
still
I've
waited
20
minutes
for
a
bartender
We've
called
one
over
twice
they
seemed
to
have
forgotten
about
us
I
just
want
pay
leave
Sucks
because
planned
on
staying
here
gamble
drink
eat
I'm
sure
if
I'll
be
back
Free

It
was
a
silent
night
when
we
attended
with
friends
Lots
of
ancient
works
oldest
I
saw
from
around
700
AD
Good
selection
Pablo
Picasso
too
Since
0

is
not
an
option
I
had
to
give
you
1
star
WHICH
YOU
DON'T
DESERVE
First
of
all
your
employees
are
INCREDIBLY
rude
ruff
and
completely
inconsiderate
patrons
am
shocked
that
business
still
open
due
being
so
unsanitary
The
Health
Department
will
be
my
next
stop
hope
if
someone
planning
a
trip

they
read
the
reviews

choose
against
it
Not

My
kids
won't
even

them
They
leave
nasty
gritty
feeling
in
your
mouth
and
bad
after
taste
oldest
went

brushed
her

it
was
so
bad
Amazing
place
Iced
Chai
Latte
was
very
flavorful
The
florentine
also
flavorful
with
a
side
of
hashbrowns
Met
a
friend
here
few
weeks
ago
and
immediately
liked
what
I
saw
as
walked
in
Greeted
by
smiling
happy
faces
it's
small
spot
but
not
crammed
up
the
large
window
facing
street
adds
great
seating
location
if
you
like
people
watching
with

Neither
of

were

The

canned
have
had

can
only

I
love
finding
cute

cozy

tasty

it's

a
trifecta
There
is
also
drive
thru
for
convenience
the
hours
are
crazy
long
6am
to
9pm

But
if
you
use

might
be
missing
out
on
phenomenal
selection
of

pastries
cookies
wraps
crepes
quiches
If
you're

maybe

What
an
eclectic
joint
This
place
has
serious
hipster
vibes
from
the
staff
to
venue
menu
The
cocktails
are
amazing
and
different
many
places
in

If

you

I'm
usually
a
fan
of
tartare
but
after
hearing
great
reviews
I
had
try
it
still
don't
love
stuff
dry
aged
tartare
was
packed
flavor
served
presentation
also
tried
fried
rabbit
surprisingly
enough
it
pretty
darn
good
way
they
cook
food
takes
away
fact
that
eating
things
very
rarely
on
other
menus
Forgive
Fernet
cocktail

because
any
drink
gin
is
my
kind
awesome
didn't
even
know
what
half
ingredients
were
me
at
tanqueray

meshed
perfectly
gin
Definitely
worth
trying
I
had
the
pleasure
to
enjoy
their
Winterlicious
menu
The
overall
experience
was
pleasant
ordered
a
French
Onion
Soup
which
is
sub
par
not
best
and
definitely
worst
New

Lamb

introducing

it
It
might
be
what
I'm
accustom
to
feel
sweet

bit
too
dominant
liking
it
complimentary
as
melt
your
mouth
struck
with
many
uncertainty
tried
hard
It's
bad
surprise
would
order
again...probably
not
Their

okay
Given
have
wrote
for

think
extremely
fair
reasonable
Would
visit
again
would
like
try
few
more
dishes
regular
Best
place
ever
If
you
have
Alyn
or
Todd
as
your
bartenders
they're
beyond
5
Star
service
The
entire
staff
is
extremely
polite
professional
and
efficient
Need
I
say
more
It's
crazy
to
go
from
FOUR
STARS

And
TWO
is
being
generous
So
I
consider
DD
do
a
majority
of

Why
oh
why
would
only
put

Understaffed
Hire
more
people
know
it's
difficult
than
it
sounds
but
problem
for
management
solve
Why
okay
with
poor
reviews
Very
slow
service
This
place
definitely
needs
some
help
So
disappointing
Let
me
start
by
saying
the
venue
is
well
designed
The
women
are
beautiful
I
did
NOT
try
any
food
items
witj
that
said
here
was
my
experience
there
We
arrive
and
go
up
to
bar
order
drinks
Hieneken

Friend
orders
a
glass

And

Felt
bad

bit
bullet
on
over
inflated
prices
focused

after
all
thats
why
we
came
Like
i
were
beautiful
plenty
them
But
they
not
seem
interested
getting
money
or
one
elses
Some
walked
back
forth
bothering
look
our
way
Eight
sitting
side
main
stage
Four
thier
cell
phones
non-attention
recieved
left
hope
this
just
an
off
night
With
four
other
strip
clubs
within
5
minutes
same
street
can
get
better
likelihood
returning
highly
unlikely
The
atmosphere
was
great
but
service
and
food
poor
Took
45
minutes
to
get
lunch

Server
didn't
seem
very
polished
my
husband
and
I
went
here
for
Happy

tonight
The
waitress
was
very
nice
attentative
but
the
food
on

hand
awful
My

grease
filled
slices
of
pizza
a
greasy
burger
with
onion
rings
fries
that
were
way
too
salty
inedible.We
really

to
sit
outside

so
we
loud
crowded

ugh
cannot
believe

25
dollars

We
will
not
be

back
I
have
been
wanting
to
try
Tryst
Cafe
for
some
time
now...ever
since
reading
about
it
in
Phoenix
Magazine
We
called
ahead
make
reservations
and
while
the
hostess
was
extremely
polite
she
asked
if
we
had
a
Travel
Zoo
coupon
Well
couldn't
understand
what
said
because
talked
so
fast
but
that
fine...I
didn't
So
get
restaurant
are
sat
outside
immediately
looked
over

our
waitress
were
impressed
with

of
options
especially
GF

at

given
any
just
await

10
minutes
later

At

into
our
brand
new
home
a
month
ago
and
went
with

to
us
Since

like

every

were
clearly
concerned

thought
have

for

48

look
at

Well
not

My

I

Loaded

Seating

af
think
that's
how
kids
say
it
these
days
Like
many
cool
joints
around
toronto
90's
hip
hop
seems
always
be
playing
Stop
listen
while
you
enjoy
some
funky
flavors
I'd
go
right
now
if
could
I
had
come
in
really
early
after
dropping
off
at
the
airport
Once
again
staff
is
attentive

courteous
John
was
excellent
told
him
would
be
here
for
a
few
hours
until
it
time
to
leave
work
He
switched
out
regular
coffee
carafe
large
one
Checked
on
me
times
and
quite
pleasant
The
food
always
yummy
music
selection
pleasant
but
not
too
loud
The
WORST
wait
lines
Every
single
time
I've
been
the
lines
are
terrible
to
check
out
no
one
seems
care
have
a
sense
of
urgency
or
think
ask
for
help
with
checking
out
customers
It's
sad
it's
new
store
and
great
location
but
customer
service
be
going
Frys
instead
Some
of
if
not
the
best
prices
in
town
on
meat,.liquor
produce
and
groceries
They
constantly
comparison
shop
to
beat
others
prices
A
lot
of
variety
always
clean
well
stocked
24
hours
right
off
215
what
else
could
you
want
This
is
my
staple
grocery
store
Excellent
coffee
and
open
before
7am
Most
independent
coffee
joints
don't
until
7
here
in
CLE
so
that
extra
half
hour
is
really
clutch
on
the
most
unfortunate
mornings
when
I
need
to
be
at
work
extra-early
Huge

this
establishment
for
making

such

Sure
it's
not
THAT
cheap
but

when
you're
starving
content
also
like
the
set
up
You
order
right
you
walk
in
and
get
number
Then
sit
down
wherever
food
gets
delivered
to
you
It
SUPER
quick
We
were
starving
we
got
there
didn't
have
wait
long
since
it
much
our
table
minute
sat
down
It's
great
because
unlike
other
restaurants
this
is
more
cafeteria
style
place
where
just
eat
don't
worry
tipping
or
getting
bill
Would
definitely
come
here
again
nice
first
experience
Mmmm
Love
it
Pack
as
much
you
can
into
the
bowl
and
bring
home
your
leftovers
I
get

In

The
quality
of
the
food
dropped
significantly
as
their
popularity
increased
I
ordered
from
them
very
first
month
in
business
which
was
something
like
2006
and
pretty
regular
for
many
years
but
have
no
desire
to
eat
there
anymore
Banjara

when

only

It's

it's

They

My
husband

I
came
here
for
dinner
on
a
Saturday
evening
We
were
seated
at
booth
as
soon
we
walked
in
ordered
drinks
Then
had
their
specialty
the
grilled
cheese
burger
It
was
unlike
anything
I've
ever
before
There
no
bun
it
buttered
bread
made
just
like
cheese
except
there
burger
inside
Quite
yummy
would
definitely
recommend
it
bacon
he
liked
Said
not
great
The
fries
really
good
quite
quite
loud
due
to
party
in
bar
area
But
night
place
good
so
could
expect
lot
of
people
try
it
service
good
too
Here
tonight
for
my
wedding
anniversary
This
is
one
of
the
best
seafood
restaurants
I've
ever
eaten
at
The
server
Leontine
told
us
that
received
fresh
daily
We
had
hush
puppies
which
were
baked
to
perfection
You
sit
right
next
kitchen
because
it
a
small
intimate
place
But
it's
pretty
cool
you
get
watch
chefs
in
action
I
watched

with
such

just
saw

who
leaving

she
her

still

came
and

them
even
though

For
manager's
record
this
Joelle
What
customer
service
This
place
is
best
summed
up
in
a
list
of
pros
and
cons
PRO
The
most
creative
selection
specialty
rolls
I've
seen
while
nice
ambiance
beautiful
presentation
real
crab
CONS
It
little
pricey
to
certain
extent
this
warranted
given
ambiance
crab
menu
selection
Specific
to
my
visit
I
gotta
say
was
intrigued
by
the
idea
Buffalo
Chicken
Roll
but
it
disappointment
Not
very
much
flavor
at
all
considering
you're
getting
chicken
for
price
sushi-grade
seafood
not
great
value
either
My
other
roll
fantastic
so
it's
indicative
all
their
food
I'd
just
take
pass
on
that
one
roll
And
finally
shout-out
server
She
quick
attentive
perky
genuinely
pleasant
interact
with
The
repair
person
came
the
day
after
I
called
charge
was
65
for
service
call
He
arrived
shortly
calling
well
identified
in
uniform
After
looking
at
refrigerator
that
ice
maker
didn't
work
he
quoted
a
490.00
job
to
replace
unit
paid
and
then
did
further
research
Within
15
minutes
found
part
store
20
away
120.00
It
took
install
and
is
not
knowing
exactly
what
doing
everything
now
works
perfectly
definitely
an
overkill
120.00
would
take
less
than
install
MMMMMMMMMM
so
glad
I
came
to
this
buffet
Came
for
brunch
and
wanted
die
after
from
eating
much
The
interior
is
soooo
amazing
or
at
least
near
the
huge
roof
waiters
are
nice
they
cleared
finished
plates
fast
Many
different
cuisine
selections
sushi
oysters
pasta
salad
bar
breakfast
fruit
etc
Some
of
my
favs
included
Eggs
benedict
Pasta
Pancakes
Pizza
Risotto

Carrot
Cake
Gelato
that
just
lacked
Salad
bar
Shrimp
Cocktail

every
single
time
It's
a
true
small
diner
feel
You
walk
in
seat
yourself
the
food
is
exceptional
personally
love
biscuits
and
gravy
eggs
benedict
The
owner
makes
his
rounds
just
friendly
vibe
They
remember
you
treat
like
they
really
value
your
business
Great
local
spot
Airport
food
is
overpriced
Agree
But
this
sushi
place
nice
and
clean
with
the
option
of
picking
a
pre-made
carryout
dish
or
ordering
fresh
made
from
bar
if
you
want
to
dine-in
I
had
chefs
special
roll
oceans
delight
it
was
good
but
loosely
rolled
so
some
pieces
fish
kept
falling
out
seaweed
broke
in
places
couldn't
neatly
dunk
my
soy
sauce
tuna
avocado
roll
great
Fast
service
cute
atmosphere
fish
Good
spot
for
sushi
recommend
It's
refreshing
to
have
amazing
coffee
and
great
service
which
is
hit
miss
at
larger
chains
Starbucks
The
staff
was
so
friendly
double
checking
my
order
making
sure
I
liked
it
before
left
ordered
a
DD
cold
brew
with
Carmel
sweetener
half
amazing
will
be
back
This
was
our
first
time
to
Container
Park
and
I
so
happy
see
a
little
vegan
place
could
grab
my
lunch
at
got
the
tacos
with
tomato
basil
tortilla
which
she
said
would
turn
it
more
into
burrito
also
one
of
juices

Sweetheart
The
burrito/taco
delicious
but
felt
maybe
disproportionate
amount
imitation
meat
compared
veggies
Too
much
faux
guess
that's
what
usual
American
diet
enjoys
Or
some
added
whole
beans
be
good
But
still
great
came
side
salad
herb-peppery
dressing
that
delectable
juice
wasn't
as
sweet
expected
not
why
fine
will
definitely
trying
from
here
next
go
Arts

Don't
call

your

a

don't

I
explained
my
situation
she
said
sorry
can't
help
I've
been
here
a
few
times
for
eyelash
extensions
It
is
often
difficult
to
get
in
touch
with
someone
schedule
an
appointment
phone
tag
and
when
you
do
speak
someone
they
are
quite
booked
From
the
go
lashes
look
great
but
despite
following

The

really
coarse
as
said
DO
NOT
stay
on
well
at
all
My
last
was
straw
owner/manager
literally
got
into
screaming
match
another
client
about
appointment
Although
fault
owner
super
rude
argumentative
obviously
demonstrated
all
of
her
comebacks
their
negative
reviews
so
unprofessional
Paul
Draper
is
a
gem
Over
the
past
five
years
I've
had
privilege
of
working
with
many
times
From
his
incredible
mentalism
to
comedy
and
audience
participation
does
wonderful
job
engaging
creating
lasting
memories
His
extensive
knowledge
anthropology
adds
show
experience
he
can
expertly
adapt
performances
audience
professional
flexible
always
pleasure
work
with
For
anyone
looking
for
quality
entertainment
that
your
guests
will
remember
I
would
absolutely
recommend
Draper
The
teriyaki
was
good
Cooked
right
but
a
little
too
much
onion
served
with
it
I
being
from
costal
state
usual
don't
get
sushi
when
travel
in
the
mid-west
But
other
reviews
figured
would
live
little
Sushi
wasn't
bad
portions
were
good
and
some
of
rolls
cut
big
for
one
mouthful
Ask
about
specials
you
go
If
sitting
at
bar
ask
if
chef
has
special
roll
they
like
to
make
Hibachi
fill
needs
reservation
as
it
appears
it's
only
open
certain
times
This
place
is
AMAZING
Great
food
variety
good
prices
It's
very
pretty
inside
yet
it's
not
too
fancy
Also
this
uses
organic
food
and
has
vegan
gluten
free
options
Came
to
Moroco
with
my
boyfriend
for
a
last-minute
brunch
in
Yorkville
as
we
were
staying
the
area
My
had
been
few
years
prior
and
experienced
great
meal
so
I
was
excited
try
it
out
First
impression
The
place
is
very
chic
Loved
decor
especially
patio
those
macaroon-inspired
pillows
too
cute
We
sat
on
patio
ordered
Shakshuka
Avocado
Benny
shakshuka
came
out
hot
but
portion
quite
small
also
found
be
salty
side
request
extra
baguette
slices
only
3
thin
slices
which
barely
enough
Overall
nothing
special
would
hesitate
come
back
Kudos
to
anyone
who
does
not
have
take
a
box
go
because
the
portions
here
are
huge
It
took
us
while
sort
through
what
we
wanted
try
but
ended
up
with
fiesta
skillet
with
salsa
and
chili
country
fried
steak
skillet
cup
of
chili
The
main
orders
also
came
banana
nut
muffin
that
BF
really
liked
His
was
much
better
than
mine
I
think
partly
didn't
taste
fresh
I
envisioned
something
along
lines
pico
de
gallo
don't
know
why
his
gravy
sooo
good
So
would
be
my
recommendation
chili
fantastic
too
We
taking
half
each
plus
almost
3/4
home
And
swear
were
hungry
begin
with
this
is
great
option
if
you
looking
for
more
local

Oh

Very
strange
experience
I
don't
know
why
the
restaurant
offers
groupons
if
they
are
so
obviously
unhappy
when
people
with
vouchers
show
up
We
had
been
walking
behind
a
couple
smoking
joint
as
we
made
our
way
to
resto
from
metro
First
waited
5
minutes
before
being
seated
in
quite
an
empty
restaurant
Then
it
took
about
20
for
waiter
bring
us
water
and
answer
questions
It
was
very
frustrating
sitting
there
watching
him
walk
by
tending
that
shown
up
approx
10
after
serving
us
The
really
tried
pushing
drinks
on
several
times
said
no

more
than
once
only
say
so
just

then
me
few
understand

meant
this

By

extremely
anxious
uncomfortable

Happy

Great
food
but
terrible
service
When
we
entered
there
were
plenty
of
empty
tables
the
wait
was
15-20
minutes
and
then
people
who
came
in
behind
us
seated
before
us
It
a
chaotic
atmosphere
it
seemed
hostesses
not
able
to
control

rude
just

It's

Don't

Well
done
This
nail
salon
is
very
clean
and
professional
Based
off
the
reviews
I
took
my
mom
for
her
birthday
to
get
a
pedicure
they
did
an
amazing
job
went
back
yesterday
sat
with
Jazmine
She
incredible
job
nails
has
loyal
client
in
me
Our
family
loves
this
place
The
food
is
always
great
the
service
personable
and
their
desserts/breads
are
to
die
for
owner
usually
present
at
store
especially
when
they
have
a
rush
I've
never
had
bad
experience
there
favorites
turkey
bacon
salad
chicken
bbq
avocado
sammie
of
course
kids
meals
soups
You
can't
go
wrong
with
anything
you
order
here
it
comes
desserts
Where
else
can
get
unlimited
fresh
french
toast
for
breakfast
This
place
is
honestly
one
of
my
favorite
places
to
escape
to
It
has
the
perfect
amount
light
for
studying
cool
performances
by
local
artists
and
poets
right
serving
caffeine
keep
me
alive
must
also
be
a
number
people
in
Cleveland
because
it
nearly
always
crowded
Trying
grab
table
can
hectic
but
once
you're
seated
it's
great
relax
enjoy
your
hot
beverage
Be
sure
try
their
assortment
teas
You
will
certainly
find
you
The
local
staff
is
awesome
However
the
regional
manager
and
public
storage
policy
works
against
customers
who
want
to
consume
spend
more
with
storage
This
work
aggravates
frustrates
alienates
me
It
was
really
weird
for
me
have
work
so
hard
give
money
company
all
while
having
managers
avoid
doing
business
company
The
club
is
nice
but
the
people
are
assholes
My
girl
got
groped
by
some
idiot
in
crowd
have
no
respect
for
women
and
need
to
learn
how
others
We
came
Chainsmokers
left
middle
of
set
due
crowd
So
if
you
like
being
strange
men
rubbed
up
on
booty
danced
generally
assaulted
then
this
place
you
After
visiting
I
won't
return
definitely
not
sending
anyone
know
here
Great
show
horrible
experience
Walked
in
10
people
ahead
of
us
they
said
politely
there
would
be
a
15
minute
wait
Really
were
20
Yes
tables
and
booths
EMPTY
Whoever
owns
this
site
needs
new
manager
is
idiotic
Five
minutes
to
get
a
menu
when
they
are
not
busy
Then
told
half
the
breakfast
items
available
Nachos
please......"no
we
only
serving
breakfast
it
is
just
that
you
anything
Horrible
I've
been
wanting
to
drop
by
this
place
since
I
live
quite
near
the
area
When
finally
did
it
is
as
good
expected
be
ordered
brisket
sandwich
felt
like
died
and
went
heaven
sat
bar
observed
chefs
in
action
they
were
very
professional
have
put
so
much
love
effort
into
each
dish
served
Kudos
all
hard
working
people
restaurant
will
be
coming
back
again
again
I've
used
this
garage
door
service
to
fix
some
issues
that
I
had
with
my
door
The
was
very
prompt
and
didn't
have
any
the
technician
trying
up-sell
me
anything
came
out
repaired
what
needed
attention
it
only
took
him
about
30
minutes
So
far
based
on
first
experience
company
would
definitely
go
them
again
This
place
has
amazing
sushi
rolls
They
have
all
your
classics
but
where
they
really
hit
home
is
with
their
innovative
house
Even
the
garnishes
were
and
beautiful
I
had
Fujisan
an
eel
Fuji
apple
roll
sauce
sweetness
crunch
perfection
It
truly
made
my
mouth
water
My
husband
opted
for
Omakase
a
one
of

Not
exactly
sure
why
this
place
is
rated
4

The

They

I

Mexican

Good
NYC
pizza
We
had
the
Hawaiian
Punch
pizza
which
bacon
ham
pineapple
pieces
and
excellent
crust
Great
ordered
a
large
pizza
because
we
like
leftovers
eight
slices
in
pie
If
you
double
cut
it
would
be
chain
size
slices
enjoyed
flavors
crust
was
awesome
I
lived
these
were
pizzas
similar
to
city
The
location
is
off
Potter

right
by
gas

They
have
few
parking
spots
front
or

either

Good
little

in

Hard

blow
me
away
but
it
was
a
great
lunch...I
had
burger
based
on
bartenders
recommendation
and
didn't
disappoint...their
fries
were
really
good
because
they
are
hand
cut...always
bonus...I
would
definitely
come
back
try
other
things
here
for
sure
Alexis
spent
almost
an

helping

find
the

I
love
will
definitely
be

TexMex
Consistently

Not

except
the
carne

or

Both
are

Favorites
when

is
Fish

Burrito
which
breaks

rule
of

but
it
works
The

Quesadilla's

Quick

which
always

Oh
Super
Nachos
great
healthy
at
all
Fresh

Easy
surprised
me
They
don't
have
the
biggest
selection
but
what
they
do
is
well
thought
out
and
very
priced
It
would
seem
that
FE
caters
to
single
person
small
family
households
which
great
Their
premade
food
tasty
soups
are
awesome
I
am
constantly
shocked
at
how
cheap
meat
here
My
freezer
stocked
full
of
chops
chicken
about
half
cost
pay
elsewhere
You
can't
get
all
your

done
FE
it's
an
enjoyable

I'm

Ordered
the
black
dragon
my
go
to
sushi
and
it
really
hit
sushi
craving
The
fish
rice
ration
were
perfect
but
roll
kept
falling
apart
every
time
I
picked
up
Got
spicy
mayo
on
side
was
actually
spicy
unlike
other
places
Also
disappointed
that
they
didn't
serve
any
ginger
wasabi
though
What
terrible
service
We
stayed
in
the
775
SF
1bed
suite
and
when
we
checked
early
morning
requested
a
strip
view
close
to
an
elevator
with
pack
n
play
for
baby
ended
up
getting
airport
at
end
of
longest
hotel
hallway
I've
ever
seen
no
play
The
must
have
been
several
hundred
feet
long
I
called
see
if
could
switch
rooms
was
hold
20
mins
just
find
out
there
nothing
they
do
guess
all
tower
suites
are
hallways
so
won't
fault
them
that
entire
stay
had
mysterious
sewer
smell
coming
bathroom
which
engineer
said
from
other
above
us
Our
3rd
day
included
running
water
lights
would
periodically
not
work
also
automatic
shade
that
didn't
work
needed
be
repaired
All
these
incidents
happened
individually
each
time
10-20
minutes
I'll
never
get
back
For
trouble
wasted

were
only

Today

We
walked
away
first
because
it's
so
damn
noisy
My
son
with
us
today
so
when
we
arrived
he
asked
hostess
for
a
quieter
spot
to
sit
She
sat
on
north
side
patio
which
much
nicer.Corben
our
server
efficient
great

The
menu
is
short
and
sweet
This
tells
me
food

I
had
brisket
polenta
Very
tasty
presentation
excellent
all
dishes
at
table
must
say
though.......the
lemonade
amazing
were
satisfied
what
ate
isn't
your
ordinary
restaurant
in
satisfying
I
have
been
here
twice
so
far
Wednesday
nights
are
great
with
select
bottles
of
wine
half
price
and
live
entertainment
The
pizza
is
great
And
Geraldo
the
best
Latest
experience
was
horrible
All
the
food
I
tried
gross
mashed
potatoes
were
runny
salad
bar
had
about
two
toppings
to
choose
from
meat
marbled
with
fat
Super
disappointed
what
a
waste
of
26
per
person
I'm
leaving
hungry

We
walked
up
with
a
group
of
8
and
we
only
had
to
wait
few
minutes
before
being
seated
The
appetizers
came
super
fast
got
pork
nachos
honestly
just
get
bunch
orders
these
they
were
amazing
I
ordered
the
carne
asada
burrito
which
was
pretty
yummy
meat
good
but
cheese
beans
made
meal
Overpriced
and
dull
This
clip-joint
nickle-and-dimes
you
to
death
The
food
is
of
decent
quality
but
UHM
HAY
WHERE
THE
FLAVA
AT
only
stand-out

I
encountered
at
Lulu's
was
the
Al
Pastor
which
tasty

not
nearly
as
spicy
felt
it
could
or
should
be
If
weren't
for
would
have
received
a
2
star
review
beans
rice
were
also
bland
flavorless
Food
prepared

it's
pretty
hard

if
you're

My

We
consider

a
hidden
gem
had
the

it
was

The

It
is
slightly

from

Chinese

that
I've
seen
will
be
coming
back
here
on
my

I

never
go
anywhere
else
for
a
massage
I've
been
here
twice
one
massage
with
licensed
therapist
Odette
and
another
student
Both
were
fantastic
such
great
value
feel
like
their
technique
is
just
as
good
big
chains
but
at
half
the
price
Everyone
so
friendly
environment
peaceful
relaxing
from
moment
you
walk
in
When
paying
can
also
get
cash
tip
instead
of
adding
it
after

bank
to

Plus
don't
need
worry
about
stopping
an

beforehand
This
place
value
seems
be
teaching

Love

this

Hideous

Bought

it

discoloured
They
essentially
said
too
bad
Snotty
sales
guys
Stay
away
Over
priced
I
had
an
appointment
to
switch
over
winter
tires
They
left
me
waiting
for
two
hours
their
excuse
being
that
there
were
several
similar
vehicles
of
the
same
model
as
mine
However
they
failed
pack
three
my
summer
tires
in
car
after
appointment
so
drive
back
get
them
After
weeks
of
shopping
around
I
finally
found
the
perfect
truck
The
guys
at
Chandler
Car
and
Truck
Sales
were
amazing
As
a

really
appreciated
hassle

will
definitely
be

Hard
to
remember
another

Yinzes
say
it's

but
I
disagree
the

Very
progressive

not
too
wild
products
are
near

very
knowledgable

And

Just

Delicious

Sunday
the
manager
Josh
said
he
will
fix
issue
I
wait
and
see
give
them
another
chance
or
they
loose
me
as
customer
do
to
food
but
service
is
top
notch
My
fiance
and
I
went
to
Bridge
Ten
Brasserie
this
evening
we
love
it
David
our
waiter
is
the
ONE
French
guy
in
Pittsburgh
really
awesome
at
his
job
He
was
super
knowledgeable
friendly
entertaining
The
owner's
son
front
of
house
also
very
friendly
We
tried
escargot
for
first
time
have
nothing
compare
it
to
but
good
got
a
veal
dish
cream
sauce
as
well
chicken
dish
both
were
exceptional
David
prepares
some
dishes
dining
room
which
fun
watch
Overall
had
an
amazing
dinner
can't
wait
go
back
Single
ladies
and
for
the
men
that
need
to
make
small
home
improvement/repair
projects
this
is
your
store
Home
improvements
are
so
much
easier
when
you
have
right
person
helping
you
I'll
go
in
tell
sales
what
I'm
trying
do
they're
there
me
pick
out
exactly
I
my
project
If
feel
still
not
understanding
they
will
actually
draw
diagrams
help
out
Believe
me
some
of
projects
thought
were
over
head
a
breeze
accomplish
sprinkler
system
drip
plumbing
repairs
lawn
care
etc
Now
gas
expensive
if
you're
sure
all
items
project
just
phone
call
away
You
can
buy
same
small
repairs
about
price
as
Depot
Whenever
Depot
about
4
miles
away
it
takes
forever
find
anyone
questions
read
label
I
too
With
Ace
Hardware
employees
very
knowledgeable
Don't
take
word
see
yourself
You've
like
accomplished
something
did
on
own
instead
hiring
paying
someone
you
splurge
new
outfit
because
save
bunch
doing
yourself
Give
them
try
Yogurtology
is
the
best
hot
spot
for
yogurt
in
Scottsdale
Flan
one
of
my
favorite
flavors
or
even
just
tart
Once
you
try
it
will
be
hooked
Friendly
staff
now
knows
me
by
name
I
dream
about
yogurtology
and
when
wake
up
go
get
it
I
had
an
amazing
time
here
It
was
like
a
museum
with
all
the
animals
around
little
scary
but
amazing
There
were
tons
of
different
departments
to
search
through
whether
it's
fishing
hunting
camping
bow
etc
This
my
first
and
definitely
not
last
visit
Cabela's
The
cafe
delicious
Bison
bratwurst
fries
worried
it
would
be
too
gamey
wasn't
fries
best
by
far
will
back
for
more
soon
Some
of
the
most
delicious
Indian
food
I
have
ever
had
The
dishes
are
spicy
but
heat
is
balanced
with
incredible
complexity
flavours
Fish
Goan
Curry
was
a
favourite
Go
now
I
love
this
place
Come
here
every
time
we
crave
sushi
can
never
complain
fresh
good
quality
food
Nice
place
very
clean
and
big
cake
choice
Great
service
saved
the
day
when
another
company
failed
Will
use
them
for
all
my
embroidery
needs
from
now
on
Stayed
in
Stratosphere
last
year
Comparatively
better
inside
than
Excalibur
which
I
selected
this
year
the
same
price
range
But
would
not
probably
go
there
again
simply
because
of
the
location
Advertised
as
north
Strip
but
think
officially
speaking
it
is
downtown
already
Quoting
a
Vegas
comedian
Las
rule
number
3

Depth
Perception
Just
you
can
see
Stratosphere
does
mean
that
block
away
It
not
After
Sahara
closed
became
also
somewhat
isolated
practically
nothing
between
and
Circus
which
or
two
have
uploaded
photo
Las
Blvd
at
Stratosphere
Does
look
like
Strip
So
forget
enjoying
walk
if
no
hurry
always
cab
bus
Went
to
tower
couple
times
was
package
central
part
Strip
distance
are
almost
lights
So
question
comes
mind
Why
am
here
there
Love
this
pizza
joint
Service
and
staff
is
excellent
They
are
always
extremely
nice
welcoming
have
the
BEST
philly
cheesesteak
sandwich
ever
I
crave
Gold
wings
all
time
Pizza

too
This
a
must
Danyelle
Groves
took
really
good
care
of
me
and
my
family
so
much
that
we
came
back
2
days
later
to
purchase
more
items
She
was
very
knowledgeable
didn't
try
push
anything
on
us
I
would
highly
recommend
going
see
her
for
any
your
home/furniture
needs
Tell
Abby

you
This
is
one
of
our
go
to
spots
Always

love
this
store
so
much
meet
the
run
club
on
Sunday
mornings

Weds
evenings
and
do
my
running
clinic
Thurs
evenings
This
place
is
an
incredible
abundance
of
gear
But
what
makes
really
shine
stand
out
its
staff
The
staff
knowledgeable
instructors
are
friendly
think
participants

Even
when
first
joined

greeted
with
a
smile
welcomed
manager

I
went
here
with
a
group
of
12
or
so
friends
to
celebrate
birthday
My
friend
loves
country

this
was
great
surprise
for
him
The
service
great
starting
making
the
reservations
they
informed
me
different

and
activites

Our
waitress
excellent
effort

all
our
names
keep
bills
separate
She
came
around

us
more
than
enough
too
We
had
lot
fun

It's

Single

The
food
was
amazing
and
we
will
come

lot
more
after
this
meal
A
double-whammy
Good-for-you
food
AND
cupcakes
Yet
another
Guy
Fieri
spot
that
we
had
to
check
out
while
vacationing
in
Ohio
I'm
a
sucker
for
place
has
breakfast
all
day

so
that's
the
column
ordered
from
Our

My
fiancé
Biscuits

topped
with
soft
scrambled
eggs

Very
healthy
very
filling
delicious
For
dessert
on
go
Vanilla
Bean
cupcake
Malted
Chocolate
Buttercream
The
cake
too
dense
contrasted
super
buttery
frosting
Overall
wasn't
excited
about
it
but
still
enjoyed
it
There
needs
be
more
restaurants
like
this
price
you
pay
get
yummy
food
at
feels
homey
welcoming

Cafe
Tandoor
is
a
good
option
for
Indian
food
on
the
far
west
side
of
CLE
The
restaurant
located
in
nondescript
strip
mall
right
off
Detroit
and
Crooker
close
to
Crooker

Current

Portion

while
I
did
have
an
issue
being
offered
would
prefer
paying
more
having
part
meal
Really
looking
forward
to
a
pizza
splurge
The
restaurant
smells
like
stale
beer
so
I
opted
sit
at
the
bar
outside
Ordered
simple
salad
and
Mexigano
thin
slice
Salad
was
difficult
eat
lettuce
pieces
were
giant
vegetables
not

Pizza
very
good
only
good
thing
about
visit
Service
terrible
It
took
long
time
order
even
though
there
3
other
guests
2
bartenders
had
help
myself

Good
they
within
reach
No
one
asked
how
my
food
was
water

My
cup
sat
empty
next
for
12
minutes
finally
someone
dropping
off
dirty
glass
box
Still
no
acknowledgment
from
bartenders
offer
of

or
check

Another
6
minutes
go

Threw

Next
I'll
get
takeout
Just
got
back
from
this
place
It
was
a
recommendation
friend
and
it
fantastic
I
had
the
chef
table
seating
made
food
in
front
of
us
to
our
tastes
In
case
we
mentioned
avoid
dairy
pork
The
fantastic
tartar
pasta
with
homemade
tomato
sauce
pulled
lamb
on
noodles
etc
Will
definitely
go
again
Alex
LOL
We
went
there
for
their
Jim's
day
my
husband
is
Jim
and
why
not
get
a
free
burger
haha
It
was
our
first
time
in
this
location
I
impressed
with
the
decor
neatness
of
place
Our
server
great
she
attentive
very
friendly
did
have
to
return
turkey
burger
because
it
so
over
salted
my
mouth
hurting
from
one
bite
And
actually
like
salty
food
never
returned
burger
life
The
absolutely
fine
quickly
brought
me
another
dish
ordered
Overall
nice
experience
I'd
go
back
again
if
I'm
neighborhood
Went
in
today
because
of
the
Yelp
reviews
and
wasn't
disappointed
The
staff
is
very
friendly
they
were
extremely
careful
gentle
with
our
cats
even
though
one
them
got
a
shot
he
didn't
fuss
or
appear
to
be
too
panicked
over
it
Will
happily
take
my
animals
back
here
again
as
needed
I
love
their
bacon
egg
on
a
bisquit

bought
quite
few
this
past
summer
hash
browns
are
hit
and
miss
every
if
you
request
well
done
or
crispy
Their
coffee
was
surprisingly
good
Definite
my
go
too
breakfast
place
Came
here
on
a
Thursday
night
after
volleyball
I
think
everyone
else
came
too
so
the
place
was
packed
They
were
extremely
understaffed
that
and
waiter
stressed
out
He
did
not
hide
it
well
Food
took
forever
to
come
ordered
seafood
pasta
It
hard
chew
OMG
Just
finished
my
meal
Simply
the
Best
Biscuits
bomb
Pancakes
Bomb
and
I
won't
even
mention
Mimosas

Lord
If
you
live
here
or
visiting
MUST
Stop
in
Food
was
really
good
waitress
as
well
I
enjoyed
the
atmosphere
It
is
very
much
like
a
Smith
and
Wolenski
Grille
area
noise
wise
We
went
outside
door
near
restaurant
hostess
section
for
air
so
my
colleague
could
get
smoke
in
between
apps
dinner
bouncer
closed
looked
5
minutes
we
were
out
there
Big
guy
with
beard
When
walked
up
to
open
door
which
glass
he
see
us
it
locked
asked
him
push
handle
open
told
Us
go
around
explained
middle
of
came
through
that
don't
even
know
where
around
was
He
us
didn't
care
find
other
door
where
just
away
mid
sentence
completely
rude
Is
this
restaurant
thought
If
some
our
party
weren't
still
there
would've
left
honestly
do
lot
bank
work
Toronto
Won't
be
bringing
clients
anymore
had

Nice
wine
tab
well
over
1000
you

45

Obviously

how
good
food
is
not

places

By
way
The

another

So
could've
taken
2
secs
handle
Instead
rude
made
take
hike
back
already
waiting
Beer
Excellent
Food
Doesn't
Disappoint
Appetizers
are
cheaper
before
6pm
and
so
is
beer
Good
times
here
Not
too
loud
but
definitely
not
quiet
At
least
you
can
hold
a
conversation
at
the
bar
your
table
without
shouting
across
to
company
Located
inside
the
New
Kennedy
Square
plaza
this
pharmacy
is
conveniently
located
beside
two
clinics
which
allows
for
quick
access
patients
needing
to
pharmacy
This
has
a
higher
variety
of
prescriptions
compared
one
I
usually
go
the
across
from
medical
centre
in
First
Markham
Place
Service
also
very
good
with
owner
being
energetic
male
who
would
always
discuss
you
how
properly
take
prescriptions
I'll
definitely
come
store
if
my
local
doesn't
have
family
needs
First
time
here
and
boy
do
they
give
a
lot
of
toppings
I
went
for
the
lunch
special
7
you
get
miso
soup
build
your
own
salad
their
house
brew
tea
to
drink
Tuna
was
fresh
delicious
would
def
come
back
I
love
this
restaurant
Came
to
Scottsdale
for
business
had
lunch
there
2
days
in
a
row
Wish
they
one
back
home
Texas
I
had
my
first
experience
at
jack
flaps
today(1-26-14
and
it
definitely
won't
be
last
After
checking
out
the
menu
online
to
see
what
they
offer
understood
this
wasn't
your
typical
breakfast
place
decided
on
fat
elvis
a
side
of
coke
braised
slab
bacon
The
flavors
peanut
butter
bananas
bacon
tasted
great
top
waffles
thicker
cut
was
nice
change
instead
thinly
sliced
you'd
normally
eat
any
other
spot
seemed
pack
more
flavor
too
sampled
few
bites
from
plates
others
with
tried
candied
jalapeño
jackflaps
along
crab
benedict
Both
those
items
did
not
disappoint
either
Our
server
named
Kevin
excellent
very
friendly
rest
staff
were
too
clearing
empty
refills
but
point
being
annoying
I'd
recommend
getting
there
early
as
filled
up
quick
after
we
arrived
9am
Overall
if
you're
looking
for
fun
delicious
it's
worth
stopping
in
Jack
Flaps
Good
parking
for
a
downtown
venue
I
love
walking
in
the
sculpture
garden
of
art
museum
during
intermission
They
always
put
on
very
professional
productions
It's
fresh
and
hot
they
are
trying
to
get
it
right
with
service
but
the
food
tastes
nothing
like
Mexican
it's
run
by
Persians
so
ok
maybe
stop
using
BBQ
sauce
from
grocery
store
on
your
burritos
try
real
Mexican
flavours
you're
sure
boost
prices
also
return
clients
If
was
tastier
I'd
consider
going
back
Otherwise
underwhelming
I
almost
want
my
money
There
are
not
many
places
in
Phoenix
you
can
go
and
pick
up
a
slice
so
Thank
Goodness
we
have
Mamma
Mia
They
just
opened
second
location
on
7th
Street
Indian
School
two
central
locations
to
choose
from
This
new
also
has
cute
little
patio
the
front
Yay
for
Groupon
Otherwise
I
wouldn't
have
found
this
place
It's
tucked
in
a
strip
mall
Willoughby
and
from
the
outside
it
doesn't
look
very
promising
The
inside
isn't
all
that
promising
either
but
we're
talking
straight
pizza
here
owners
are
friendly
were
great
at
making
sure
we
satisfied
with
our
order
we
dined
in
itself
is
great
There's
distinct
crunch
when
you
bite
into
crust
that's
satisfying
choice
of
toppings
good
We
got
molta
bella
which
was
flavorful
thankfully
not
watery
like
so
many
other
veggie
heavy
white
pizzas
meat
lovers
loaded
duh
can
tell
ingredients
quality
quote
BF
The
bacon
looked
cut
up
strips
bits
get
everywhere
else
worth
eating
sorta
wished
came
some
sauce
If
you
want
to
enjoy
a
calm
drink
on
the
river
front
this
is
great
place
For
location
place
gets
5
stars
There
so
much
potential
but
drinks
and
food
are
mediocre
here
Fantastic
food

wonderful
service
After
driving
around
for
what
felt
like
hours
to
find
something
appealing
lunch
we
ended
up
here
luckily
In
an
interesting
building
slightly
hidden
but
don't
let
that
scare
you
away
from
the
cocktails
this
place
has
unique
flavor
I'm
not
into
tamales
boyfriend
is
he
LOVED
his
along
with
enchilada
taco
There
really
sweet
flavorful
happening
beans
rice
some
of
best
I've
ever
had
I
enjoys
tacos
was
impressed
when
asked
about
fish
being
grilled
or
battered
she
said
battered
could
do
grilled...I
happy
answer
The
complementary
soup
chips/salsa
are
beyond
satisfying
margaritas
HUGE
delicious
You
simply
won't
be
down
here
Beautiful
hotel...but
not
much
going
on
inside
it
The
staff
is
great
spa
very
nice
but
with
XS
and
Marquee
being
the
hot
spots
in
town
Aria
has
really
got
to
step
it
up
entertainment
factor
dining
selection
was
pretty
depressing
too
I
understand
it's
new
a
ways
go
just
hope
does....otherwise
loved
staying
here
decor
design
luxe-swank
that
exudes
more
mature
vegas
It
felt
boutique
intimate
as
well
insanely
in-your-face
big
like
other
casinos
Shopping
great
Oh
liked
idea
of
free
tram
too
drunk
utilize
though
The
windshield
guy
would
not
stop
arguing
with
me
He
even
followed
me
inside
the
store
and
caused
a
scene
All
because
I
didn't
want
to
have
my
replaced
by
car
wash
Not
mention
washes
here
are
sub
par
at
best
One
of
my
favorite
breakfast
spots
Friendly
staff
and
good
prices
I
love
the
chocolate
chip
bagels
too
I'd
recommend
getting
there
fairly
early
if
you
want
fresh
a
choice
flavors
I'll
be
going
back
Every
time
I've
been
here
my
food
has
nothing
short
of
delectable
The
French
press
coffee
is
great
As
far
as
one
the
best
things
to
get
I
recommend
chicken
and
waffles
sauce
that
comes
on
it
so
amazing
never
had
waffles
like
anywhere
else
service
always
pretty
great
too
You
guys
are
doing
a
job
here
I
visit
Scottsdale
about
twice
a
year
and
always
come
here
it
is
the
best
sushi
around
Excellent
tasting
Nigiri
rolls
Oh
WAXON
how
I
loath
you
This
is
a
long
review
so
if
you
don't
feel
like
reading
just
skip
to
the
last
paragraphs
Alright
my
first
experience
at
Waxon
was
pretty
good
happy
have
found
place
close
where
work
get
good
eyebrow
threading
done
So
happy
in
fact
that
bought
Wax
Max
package
with
them
very
day
What
that
ask
You
pay
set
fee
for
eyebrows
it's
140
think
and
can
go
as
many
times
want
for
full
year
Great
deal
thought
Unfortunately
not
so
sucker
For
those
people
reading
this
please
think
about
it
now
done
without
paying
anything
extra
STILL
refuse
back
mean
this
review
brutally
honest
can't
back
anyway
That's
bad
it
is
The
thing
is
once
buy
package
they
no
incentive
keep
loyal
Shima
girl
does
location
progressively
got
worse
worse
bad
ended
up
crooked
one
side
being
much
longer
thicker
than
other
As
started
notice
were
looking
kept
telling
myself
okay
I
felt
having
invested
Wax
Max
determined
money's
worth
However
after
time
place
decided
write
off
sense
some
anger
that's
coming
from
paid
140+tax
5
threadings
Kind
of
rip
off
right
imagine
anyone
similar
situation
would
same
More
details
on
job
Shima
typical
spent
minutes
eyebrows
isn't
because
she's
quick
efficient

she
always
misses
spots
cuts
unevenly
Always
an
exaggeration
either
happened
every
time
She
doesn't
use
tweezer
pick
missed
hairs
Then
she'll
draw
brow
powder
looks
terrible
really
thick
obvious
drawn
on
What's
hides
job
does
It's
only
when
home
wash
your
face
come
sad
realization
look

In
all
fairness
pros
Excellent
online
booking
system
Super
easy
convenient
customers
spotless
Good
location
downtown/in
PATH
They've
been
schedule
appointments
seem
be
busy
may
explain
this
which
purchased
stuff
apply
myself
They
offer
branded
bottle
water
in
I'm
mentioning
haven't
another
guess
value-add
Not
care
getting
free
certainly
make
poor
service
All
things
listed
above
are
great
but
businesses
caught
frills
forget
fundamentals
WAXON
Bar
falls
into
category
usually
vocal
job
and
occasionally
rant
yelp
going
leave
alone
what's
funny
actually
had
nerve
ask
me
Yelp
place
you're
lazy
service
kind
rude
Why
recommend
unsuspecting
potential
customers
Actually
note
reviews
from
who
reviewed
these
show
recommend
Is
such
great
compelled
jump
or
asked
to
misleading
business
practice
customers
reviews

Earn
legitimately
Another
point
against
Waxon
Advice
fellow
Yelpers
here
But
do
DON'T
suckered
buying
Max
mean
it
end
experience
And
considering
expensive
rent
PATH
expect
anyway
entire
year
package
trust
do
job
even
additional
won't
back
My
finally

again
risking

Been
here
twice
after
a
National
Jiujitsu
competition
After
maintaining

this
place
is
perfect
to
stuff

LOL
Nice
looking
on

Food
flavorful

Looking
forward

back
in

RUDE
I
very
nicely
asked
for
a
third
coat
of
polish
bc
the
lady
rushed
and
you
could
still
see
parts
first
coat
She
started
FREAKING
OUT
on
me
All
staff
came
over
to
look
at
my
nails
customers
were
starring
It
was
awful
running
her
mouth
LOUD
talking
about
me
in
different
language
so
mad
this
other
poor
nail
tech
had
do
it
while
she
went
around
techs
all
ticked
off
The
male
manager
did
nothing-no
apology
no
telling
be
quiet
I've
never
experienced
this
will
not
return-ever
And
spread
word
stay
outta
place
My
awful
too
worked
really
fast

didn't
even
file
nails
also
don't
like
frequenting
these
places
that
sit
talk
their
language
with
each
doing
your
Then
when
stood
up
another

Are
expecting
I'm
big
person
but
flowy

just
spent

crying
Awesome
Also
they
aren't
clean
They

GROSS
We
went
to
Wild
Water
Kingdom
early
on
day
where
tehy
had
claimed
we'd
have
rain
so
we
were
lucky
be
able
grab
public
tubes
The
tube
rides
OK

and
also
liked
the
Cliff
White
Lightening
but
besides
that
other
slides
weren't
great
didn't
go
in
wave
pool
sat
at
pub
front
of
it
was
5.50
I
think
for
a
domestic

They

We
visited
this
location
on
a
Saturday
afternoon
It
wasn't
busy
at
all
which
should
have
been
clue
ordered
8
inch
cheese
pizza
and
16
with
3
toppings
chips
waters
coke
The
large
was
soggy
halfway
up
each
piece
had
no
Italian
flavor
small
but
still
house
made
chips
came
out
cold
super
dark
sent
the
back
They
more
that
were
exactly
same
appeared
to
sprinkled
seasoning
managed
taste
like
packing
peanuts
insult
injury
price

Our
bill
around
42
I
could've
spent
little
went
fine
dining
place
thoroughly
disappointed
I
did
eventually
buy
a
used
car
from
Chapman
because
it
was
good
but
the
process
so
excruciating
will
avoid
if
possible
They
have
many
upsells
that
add
1500
to
price
and
they
exorbitant
document
fees
of
499
which
in
AZ
you
can't
negotiate
Also
get
internet
finance
through
them
ready
walk
couple
times
kept
dropping
While
got
liked
think
played
haggling
game
well
hate
game
The
department
also
had
an
upsell
which
tried
slip
by
me
If
possible
I'll
work
with
somebody
else
next
time
I'm
market
I
thought
the
burgers
were
good
They
are
fancy
and
elaborate
tend
to
like
my
more
plain
My
friend
his
was
one
of
best
he's
ever
had
think
it's
all
personal
preference
Overall
a
good
place
grab
beer
grub
without
leaving
hotel
Delicious
breakfast
and
fantastic
service
We
ordered
a
waffle
eggs
Benedict
Both
were
really
tasty
Our
server
Kenneth
was
super
nice
attentive
I
think
the
reason
for
low
ratings
is
because
like
all
LA
Fitness
clubs
focus
on
sales
The
facilities
are
fantastic
amazing
number
of
cardio
machines
awesome
free
weights
area
plenty
room
in
aisles
excellent
cycle
class
area
Where
they
fail
big
time
customer
service
try
to
get
someones
attention
at
counter-difficult
report
a
broken
machine-will
take
weeks
fixed
And
omg
stay
out
way
personal
trainers
They
over
stretching
areas
racquetball
courts
care
their
paying
clients
leave
machines
covered
sweat
and
equipment
laying
around
instead
putting
it
back
top
insult
came
recently
when
suddenly
cordoned
off
area
kicked
everyone
because
was
going
be
reserved
only
What
guess
that
would
ok
if
had
another
didn't
look
an
after
thought
throwing
down
small
mat
corner
This
gym
could
given
great
space

But
poor
service
sole

expensive

2.5
or

I
don't
drink
coffee
or
Starbucks
am
however
at
them
daily
for
my
Mom

sometimes
get
son
his
moch
choca
caramel
BS
but
partake
So
how
can
give
4
stars
to
a
place
Well
is
senior
that
doesn't
drive
anymore
her
regular
every
single
day
hear
it
if
there's
issues
like
cold
grounds
etc
Of
course
doing
the
purchase
deal
with
service
end
of
all
these
purchases
enjoys
hot
frap
extra
caramel
enjoy
service
The
staff
100x
faster
than
store
inside
closest
Target
so
I'm
grateful
when
in
this
area
one
Just
save
time
smile
nothing
else
keep
up
The
architecture
and
history
of
this
hotel
is
amazing
staff
was
great
rooms
were
average
but
comfortable
We
had
a
great
stay
Great
location

friendly
staff
Their
chili
is
so
good
Loved
the
spinach
dip
Will
definitely
be
going
back
This
is
authentic
hot
pot
which
a
good
sign
The
soup
base
well
prepared
and
the
sauces
are
very
nice
too
Meat
was
of
quality
veggies
were
also
fresh
environment
clean
frankly
isn't
expected
most
Asian
restaurants
especially
since
pot
gets
messy
easily
I
only
have
one
complaint
but
big
I
would
gave
them
5
easily
if
not
for
this
price
ridiculous
It
averages
down
to
about
40/person
still
overpriced
Pittsburgh
mean
know
lot
places
in
New
York
that
cheaper
than
this
Many
customers
students
sort
bewildered
me
How
do
they
afford
this
on
regular
basis
I
absolutly
loved
the
museum
have
been
saying
would
go
for
months
now
and
finally
had
time
My
favorite
was
prohabition
section
which
really
great
definitely
a
worth
see
also
actual
Heinz
Ketchup

other
Products
cool
did
not
realize
made
lot
of
products
that
where
there
pyramid
ketchup
bottles
all
put
together
to
make
one
huge
bottle
Wife
yearly
family
membership
as
we
can
over
over
found
5
floors
memorabilia
super
interesting
again
know
i
missed
things
If
in
area
suggest
history
museum
it
is
great
Wow
this
place
was
packed
at
noon
There
a
line
almost
out
the
door
when
I
entered
browsed
through
menu
while
waited
Having
eaten
Kneader's
Bakery
visited
SLC
area
interested
in
trying
sandwiches
and
baked
goods
here
to
see
if
AZ
location
as
good
my
previous
experience
decided
on
turkey
half
sandwich
4.39
hazelnut
12
grain
mint
chocolate
chip
brownie
soda
The
very
filling
with
nicely
seasoned
roast
turkey
fresh
lettuce
tomato
onion
mayo
bread
soft
large
crunchy
pieces
of
it
brownie
delicious
It
thick
fudgey
light
whipped-cream
frosting
Sodas
are
Coke-based
there
is
self
serve
fountain
Definitely
tasty
for
or
sweet
It
was
ok
but
a
little
bit
more
of
hype
in
my
opinion
I
don't
want
to
bash
anyone
I'm
hoping
review
helps
improve
things
The
customer
service
is
super
lacking
No
hi
or
anything
for
good
15-20
minutes
Awkward
We
were
still
curious
so
we
stuck
around
and
got
the
waiters
attention
order
think
because
it
started
off
on
wrong
note
then
didn't
enjoy
food
experience
as
much
after
that
By
time
our
like
ok
let's
eat
this
just
get
out
here
Sad
Ordered
a
quarter
pounder
and
got
cheese
burger
with
onions
mustard
Not
coming
back
to
this
McDonalds
Our
first
time
here
and
I
had
the
chicken
salad
my
husband
a
sandwich
We
both
loved
our
food
choices
were
very
surprised
at
quality
of
for
price
The
young
man
counter
was
friendly
we
in
out
less
than
30
minutes
Very
satisfied
will
eat
there
again
Had
an
absolute
blast
Aimed
at
kids
but
I'm
24
and
still
LOVED
it
amazed
these
beautiful
insects
My
normal
preferred
hotel
was
sold
out
so
I
gave
this
place
a
chance...big
mistake
stay
no
different
than
the
other
reviews
The
drive
wasn't
terrible
to
find
but
when
you
have
been
traveling
all
day
last
thing
want
do
if
hire
cartographer
and
Sherpa
find
hotel
While
checking
in
told
Bar
Grille

This
is
not

Grille
just

they
work
establishment
I
don't
think
this
restaurant
is
clean
Went
with
my
mom
their
for
dinner
a
couple
of
time
We
would
never
order
anything
else
besides
pho
and
the
curry
rice

One
time
we
ordered
chicken
skewer
Waited
forever
but
it
came

And
it's
cold
Like
had
been
sitting
there
while
also
was
so
hard
could
barely
eat
it
Soooo
bomb
I'm
from
out
of
town
and
this
place
is
about
8
minutes
my
hotel
I
got
the
all
you
can
eat
for
26.95
tried
Big
Easy
Special
baked
salmon
roll

sexy
lazy
special
Try
won't
be
disappointed
Their
popcorn
chicken
and
shaved
ice
is
really
good
The
place
small
but
it's
cute
not
ideal
for
big
groups
of
more
than
6
people
only
downside
that
it
a
cash
payment
they
have
an
ATM
I'm
giving
this
place
3
stars
only
because
the
staff
was
awesome
The
Food
on
other
hand
awful
We
had
calamari
as
an
appetizer
Completely
bland
It's
hard
to
make
taste
like
water
but
that
is
best
way
describe
it
My
husband
gumbo
it
okay

nothing
write
home
about
I
salmon
This
worst
part
of

It
SO
Salty
came
with

and

ate
a
couple
bites
about

n

good
Total

of
there
breakfast
You
want
some
breakfast
Cool
They
have
it
Service
also
kinda
Doing
it's
own
thing
My
only
beef
with
place
was
being
told
the
wait
would
be
40
minutes
my
friends
I
then
walked
down
to
dollar
store
kill
time
After
about
20
minutes
we
returned

in
case
they
called
us
early
This
home
girl
at
front
like
Oh
you
like
2
minutes
after
out
Uhhhhhhhhhhh
a
HUGE
difference
Only
annoying
because

She

Angel
has
always
been
such
a
good
guy
So
I
texted
since
my
Mom's
car
wouldn't
start
Since
love
far
wasn't
able
to
go
there
He
is
so
busy
all
the
time
because
he
great
guy
and
an
honest
businessman
me
back
stating
was
watching
Dodger
in
Colorado
And
just
few
mins
ago
replaced
starter
The
fix
after
sent
him
text
yesterday
we
are
old
customers
of
him...he
knew
how
important
it
made
priority
Just
know
that
makes
every
single
customer
will
be
only
one
this
car
Highly
recommended
trust
me....I
do
research
before
spending
money
there
I
want
to
give
a
shout
out
our
server
Brittany
She
was
awesome
It
happy
hour
on
Tuesday
night
and
the
place
really
busy
Not
only
did
she
NOT
write
6
person
order
down
but
got
everyone's
food
correct
very
attentive
despite
them
being
Good
with
bringing
drink
before
you
ran
out

Was
craving
fry
bread
was
going
to
go
house
But
my
husband

Customer

Hotel

have
little
GOOD
to
say
about
my
experience
with
Oishi's
lived
in
a
home
they
managed
for
nearly
2
years
After
accepting

never
spoke

person
assigned

Upon

had
indicated
there
would

if

considering

business
here
After
reading
the
other
reviews
and
hearing
good
things
about
Nostrano
we
were
expecting
a
little
more
than
got
We
started
off
with
drinks

Cognac
Old
Fashioned
Variable
High
Cloudiness
Gusty
Winds
fancy
dark
stormy
The
actually
topnotch
although
not
as
large
I
expected

turned
out
to
be
fine
because
they
savored
ordered
Dunbarton
Blue
appetizer
share
it
was
also
good
cheese
highlight
of
plate
but
everything
else
paired
well
too
For
main
course
my
girlfriend
Beef
Shortribs
Grilled
Sturgeon

very
nice
My
sturgeon

have
been
waiting

In

Also
didn't

Because

I
give
this
place
a
star
short
of
5
because
the
wait
should
make
appointments
when
have
to
bring
my
kids
but
am
so
busy

the

The

solid
I'd
definitely
come
back
I've
taken
my
car
here
half
a
dozen
times
for
hand-washes
which
normally
run
about
20
They
offer
you
discount
on
gas
if
buy
wash
but
don't
factor
that
in
because
their
prices
are
terrible
to
begin
with
That
said
20
they
do
very
decent
hand
wash
The
attention
detail
varies
of
course
depending
who
is
actually
doing
the
work
and
I
recall
ever
seeing
same
face
twice
over
all
can't
complain
few
minutes
touch-up
myself
once
get
back
home
all
it
takes

If

I
am
very
disappointed

The
only

was

When

I
walked

We
contacted

because
of
his
good
Yelp
reviews
He
was
very

This
is
my
third

I

Now
for
food
lil
anecdote
As
kid
thought
Hollandaise
sauce
this
high-class
scrumptious
liquid
gold
that
people
would
always
praise
Then
had
first
encounter
it
through
packet
know
big
mistake
but
dumb
nine-year-old
concluded
disgusting
vowed
never
try
again
But
here
am
proud
hypocrite
because
yes
yes
again
real
IS
gold
Especially
here
have
dipped
toes
in
few
other
ponds
since
vow
abstinence
place
has
them
beat
ordered
Blackstone
eggs
benny
poached
grilled
tomatoes
avocado
pork/turkey
bacon
top
toasted
English
muffins
served
their
Lyonnaise-style
potatoes
as
delicious
can
be
My
friend's
unfortunately
little
overcooked
the
yolk
wasn't
runny
at
all
which
unfortunate
championing
weeks
Other
than
that
only
wish
they
add
more
gold--I
mean
there
really
isn't
enough
Goes
without
saying
I'll
say
anyway
be
back
maybe
something
Eggs
Benedict
no
promises
TL;DR
go
This
is
my
favourite
bar
in
Toronto
Utterly
unpretentious

Steph
dimly
lit
but
not
annoyingly
so
it
just
goes
on

I
love
this

Did
mention
place
I've
been
going
to
this
location
for
years
and
always
get
the
same
nice
quality
meal
But
today
my
take
out
order
was
very
dry
chewy
as
if
it's
old
I
came
before
pickup
time
so
it
shouldn't
have
been
The
texture
different
well
maybe
a
kind
of
chicken
Very
disappointed
hardly
edible

Update
called
asked
be
replaced
I'm
happy
now
You
can
see
difference
in
chicken
sauce
of

disappointed
after

just
a
few
days
before
where

This
made
me
extremely
sad

returning
this
location
Great

server
Natasha

super
friendly
Try

Wish

tried
the
sriracha

There's
always
time
I
wish
that
didn't
have
a
negative
experience
here
but
certainly
did
The
staff
is
very
nice
had
an
interesting
when
dropped
off
coat
to
be
cleaned
for
my
upcoming
trip
New
York
All

well
and
assured
it'd
ready
in
the
next
few
days
went
pick
it
up
they
apparently
sent
out
another
cleaning
service
because
couldn't
get

minutes
two

Dr
Laney
Hochuli
both
of
them

In

A
quaint
little
building
you
might
expect
to
find
in
the
countryside
of
England
Antique
Rose
is
an
absolute
gem
There
are
not
many
small
local
businesses
this
industrial
world
we
live
in
so
walking
through

was
very
refreshing
So
cute
things
look
at
inside
and
family
who
runs
shop
some
most
heartfelt
genuine
people
I've
ever
had
honor
meeting
The
flowers
beautiful
lovely

wonderful
I
would
definitely
recommend
going
there
even
if
have
drive
a
bit
because
will
only
great
experience
maybe
make
new
friends
but
be
supporting

Anyway
they

Thanks

My
family
has
catered
food
from
this
place
multiple
times
and
it's
one
of
the
better
Afghan
places
to
order
from
especially
for
large
numbers
Their
kabli
rice
beef
kababs
are
really
good
However
what
I
absolutely
love
restaurant
is
something
that
doesn't
fit
in
with
theme
at
all

their
chicken
wings
Consider
getting
BBQ
wings
as
a
side
They've
got
sweet
tangy
sauce
they're
smothered
it
tastes
like
heaven
Bring
your
appetite
cause
you
get
quite
bit
Not
going
lie
looks
shabby
rundown
Just
warning
so
don't
expect
fancy
This
place
is
terrible
It
was
pretty
empty
and
signs
all
over
the
outside
says
happy
hour
Little
did
we
know
hour
does
not
apply
when
it
March
Madness
That
fine
but
waitress
told
us
there
a
2
drink
minimum
per
because
Madness
were
like
WTF
why
this
said
before
for
seated
No
MINIMUM
They
must
be
crazy
At
least
let
customers
know
BEFORE
getting
seated
that
even
if
are
no
deals
Never
coming
back
At
least
it
has
atmosphere
The
13
drink
was
about
an
inch
below
the
rim
of
my
martini
glass
I
had
to
have
that
corrected
immediately
before
night
started
off
wrong
whole
dinner
could
be
ruined
but
will
not
be
steak
and
mac
cheese
were
orgasmic
Not
happy
they
charge
5
for
a
ramekin
horseradish
cream
sauce
Had
gift
card
take
care
idiot
couldn't
process
it
He
made
sound
like
problem
It
issued
by
your
restaurant
sure
why
issue
actually
asked
wanted
use
or
pay
other
means
just
lost
still
nightmares
stupidity
statement
since
cards
are
as
good
cash
If
you
work
in

you'll

on
Mondays

p.m
If
you've
ever
stayed
at
any
hotel
ever
then
stay
away
from
this
place
I
travel
weekly
for
work
and
the

least
once
a
month
to

new
seasonal
items
Source

The
customer
service

here
From
moment
open

sales
associate
already
welcoming
and
asking
if
would
see
demonstration
embossing
sticker
making
know
kind
overwhelming
but
they
mean
well
so
personally
it
doesn't
bother
me
much
As

found
myself
loving
cute
banner

my
classroom
bought
donut
watermelon

I'm
crafty

Sunday

Just

look
young
but
god
damn
So
just
be
an
ass
ordered
water
Seriously

me
minute
Now
that
entire
experience
had
set
the
tone
We
ask
order
any
thing
She
would
not
check
us
Then
she
argued
about
mistake
made
Her
shirt
worn
her

time
sat
at
didn't

Since
starving

From

He
told

WTF
eventually
got
apology
owed
from
manager
Not
our
bartender
did
his
best
rectify
situation
which
why
stayed
left
with
attitude
John

Vegas
again
Love
the
food
drinks
and
staff
very
good
presentation
heard
head
chef
Lorena
speak
at
an
event
today
she
is
brilliant
first
successful
female
Latina
owner
on
strip
quite
accomplishment
Had
a
blast
with
my
Girlfriend
on
Monday
night
their
Industry
night
I
was
exhausted
from
partying
the
boys
but
after
getting
hooked
up
free
entry
stiff
12
drink
and
some
amazing
house
music....did
mention
sexy
Daft
Punk
girls
lazer
ice
blowing
confetti
dropping
heart
thumping...list
goes
on
It
one
of
best
club
nights
ever
I'd
go
back
After
finding
The
Pampered
Pinkie
on
yelp
I
decided
to
give
it
a
try
Well
my
appointment
with
Jackie
was
yesterday
and
I'm
so
in
love
hair
now
Also
the
place
itself
adorable
colorfully
decorated
super
clear
about
what
she
doing
the
length
taking
off
stuff
like
that
She
asked
lot
of
questions
which
truly
appreciated
rather
than
just
going
picture
had
looked
like
Good
thing
because
ended
up
haircut
that's
exactly
wanted
happy
will
definitely
be
coming
back
Looking
for
some
real
street
tacos
in
a
shop
this
is
the
place
to
be
Long
lines
but
well
worth
wait
There
are
three
and
each
line
has
list
of
meats
that
they
serving
So
may
be
good
idea
if
you
go
with
several
people
stand
get
want
Staff
very
friendly
Great
places
delicious
tacos
Just
got
my
italian
sandwich
Service
was
fast
French
bread
is
good
and
soft
Although
I
generally
would
like
sandwich
to
be
toasted
rate
the
a
4
star
rating
It
tastes
very
i
come
here
again
I
joined
here
a
couple
of
months
ago
This
used
to
be
Gold's
gym
but
now
it
is
Goodlife
and
don't
know
what
the
difference
because
never
went
Gold's
The
staff
very
friendly
here
more
so
when
you
are
interested
in
signing
up
Beyond
that
really
they
do...but
they're
nice
thought
would
cool
if
were
around
need
spotter
rather
than
having
disturb
another
patron
who
is
like
me
just
trying
enjoy
their
music
solitude
while
working
out
OK
should
mention
there
was
Sikh
dude
have
seen
on
patrol
he
certainly
available
needed
him
not
ever
anyone
else
Also
routine
comes
organizing
weights
section
Many
users
sloppy
put
back
think
this
could
resolved
by
presence
that
area
Finally
go
watch
TV
damn
it's
NHL
playoffs
can't
CBC
TSN
treadmills
elipticals
Now
good
stuff...they
spent
money
changing
DISMAL
lockers
men's

It's
much
nicer
now
They
PLENTY

Compared

Goodlife's
FANTASTIC

Any
les

There

even
tried
All
all
I'm
happy
call
location
MY
gym
positive
changes
happen
get
little
better
My
final
observation
climbing
wall
USED
I
LOVE
this
place
I'm
only
not
giving
Rock
Lobster
a
5
because
sometimes
the
service
is
far
too
slow
but
that
to
be
expected
in
popular
restaurant
Some
bartenders
and
servers
are
more
amazing
than
others
which
also
expected
either
way
their
caesars
They
were
made
better
when
they
first
opened
still
have
order
everytime
The
jerk
shellfish
really
messy
so
prepared
its
worth
it
very
spicy
as
like
it
Unique
sauce
on
crab
I've
never
had
before
My
boyfriend
orders
mac
cheese
he
loves
love
price
of
wine
per
ounce
super
helpful
Will
definitely
back
Tried
this
place
and
not
sure
if
I'll
go
back
Donut
was
good
but
service
lacking
We
went
to
the
drive
thru
for
whatever
reason
had
repeat
my
order
several
times
Not
gal
taking
has
ever
worked
before
because
she
could
remember
what
I
asked
for
Also
very
long
wait
think
I've
waited
about
15
minutes
in
thru
Never
wait
that
donuts
Wanted
leave
already
stuck
between
cars
I
had
to
pick
at
least
one
star
start
a
review
but
honestly
this
bar
deserves
NO
STARS

You
go
have
fun
relax
and
forget
your
problems
for
little
bit
if
you
are
in
place
where
the
bartenders
unfriendly
point
of
being
rude
HELLO
Get
new
job

Why
would
spend
my
money
that
makes
me
angry
even
be
there
Nope
nope
nope
Heads
up
JOEY
cold
unfriendly

Find
fucking
cuz
suck
what
you're
doing
now

I
walked
into
Dolce
before
seeing
a
movie
next
door
at
Harkins
Don't
waste
your
time
or
money
here
esp
when
there
are
so
many
other
choices
in
the
Valley
This
place
is
way
overpriced
and
service
awful
You'd
expect
with
all
they
spent
to
have
this
upscale-looking
place
would
hire
people
who
could
least
greet
you
not
act
snotty
Calling

too
feel
like

Terrible

We

place
at
2:45
on
a
Wednesday
with

the

was
horrendous
waited

min
before

Even

Whatever

Anyway

Let
me
start
by
saying
that
I
love
Thai
food

tried

as
well
Arizona
Ocha
Cuisine

one
of
the
top
visited
My
husband
and
spent
a
few
days
in
Las
Vegas
this
weekend
our
first
stop
soon
we
got
to

One
friends
told
us
about

try
We
decided
try
Chicken
Pad
Yum
Nur
Nam
Tok
beef
eaten
lot
beef
salad
restaurant
but
let
tell
you
something
far
best
ever
eaten
The
excellent
same
thing
goes
for
seasoning
If
do
not
like
spicy
is
you
will
definitively
be
back
when
are
Vegas
For
some
reason
Ci
Ci's
has
never
made
it
to
California
which
would
explain
why
I'd
heard
of
til
I
moved
here
Went

That
is
hard
beat
But
it's
also
big
draw
crowd
that
was
in

No

or
young

Quite
mallrat-types
guys
engaged
sort
eating
contest--I
suppose
they
could
have
just
been
hungry
And
don't
mean
sound
harsh
judgmental
but
depressing
seeing
person
who
not
by
himself
clearly
overeating
Actually
overeating
being
done

Update
On
This
Nightmare
How
Does
Company
Stay
In
Business
After
many
phone
calls
to
the
corporate
office
and
Charlotte
NC
I
finally
have
an
appt
on
May
22nd
all
carpet
Empire
installed
replaced
am
more
than
a
little
worried
about
having
them
back
in
my
home
ask
just
put
laminate
upstairs
hallway
since
this
is
only
area
where
seams
come
apart
They
can't
replace
because
they
match
rest
of
carpet
seemed
like
reasonable
request
solution
for
both
parties
The
6x12
Well
wanted
Charge
me
extra
install
unless
agreed
use
one
three
samples
sent
out
by
installer
his
way
another
job
not
sales
rep
looked
same
Maple
color
matched
nothing
home
When
tried
explain
was
told
that's
choices
get
want
pay
extra
What
joke
everything
these
people
through
audacity
money
I'm
sure
how
replacing
staircase
cost
effective
installing
6x12
but
surprises
anymore
with
company
entire
process
has
been
nightmare
from
start
it
finished
will
someone
home
who
knows
do
installation
did
living
oversee
work
time
update
results
after
if
second
complete
I'm
here
almost
everyday
this
sore
is
amazing
The
manager
knows
how
to
keep
her
store
clean
and
train
staff
She's
the
best
they've
had
in
awhile
bread
as
soft
a
pillow
crew
are
so
talkative
really
want
talk
you
Plus
they
know
load
up
those
veggies
If
you
ask
atleast
2
hours
before
catering
order
due
should
be
able
make
it
only
if
it's
not
dinner
rush
I
mean
would
get
tray
down
middle
of
having
rush
out
door
But
anyways
subway
by
far
glad
have
such
amazing
mangers
This
is
the
4th
time
in
a
year
that
my
magazine
hasn't
been
delivered
Called
many
many
times
but
only
get
busy
signal
Guess
post
master
so
reading
magazines
he/she
can't
answer

Horrible
service
Great
food
and
the
selection
is
quite
extensive
to
experience
authentic
Korean
dishes
still
be
able
dable
in
Chinese
or
Japanese
cuisine
as
well
Good
service
prices
are
reasonable
They
give
you
lots
of
side
too
so
great
if
hungry
I
was
able
to
make
an
appointment
for
next
day
service
which
great
because
have
my
in
laws
town
babysit
however
got
home
and
very
disappointed
with
results
made
get
hair
permed
The
stylist
strongly
urged
me
do
a
cut
color
instead
don't
know
if
she
just
didn't
want
perm
or
the
cost
more
but
felt
pretty
from
get-go
took
her
suggestion
desperately
needed
over
only
had
babysitters
this
time
She
dye
all

salon
is

you
will

Trashy

My

seemed
less
than
appreciative
Now
I'm
stuck

nothing
envisioned
when
130
short
be
back
I'll
spreading
word
One
of
my
favorite
burger
places
hands
down
First
time
ever
having
Elk
and
it
was
fantastic
I
may
never
eat
beef
again
to
in
Pittsburgh
The
theatre
is
good
and
I
will
say
clean
did
not
find
the
Imax
to
be
impressive
Overall
this
could
have
been
any
theater
anywhere
It
was
pretty
nondescript
Don't
be
fooled
by
the
updated
and
modern
decor
If
you
don't
plan
to
sleep
at
all...I
suppose
it
would
suffice
The
walls
are
paper
thin
customer
service/security
is
unresponsive
Our
neighbors
were
being
loud
annoying...well
past
4:30am
We
called
security
they
said
send
someone
up
45
minutes
later...nothing
Called
again...30-40
later
finally
came
up
tell
them
turn
down
Worst
night
of
sleep
Also
A/C
super
windows
block
out
sound
either
Never
again
I
came
here
with
my
family
and
was
very
disappointed
There's
a
reason
why
there's
never
wait
time
at
this
restaurant
We
were
seated
really
quickly
which
we
thought
good
sign
It
seems
that
the
staff
has
no
sort
of
uniform
hostess
us
dressed
terrible
The
appetizers
took
forever
to
come
food
followed
soon
after
but
subpar
best
fried

excited
about
burnt
got
Bella
Chicken
mushrooms
completely
burnt
almost
worst
than

shrimp
on
appetizer
menu
terrible
had
send
it
back
And

even
left

when
didn't
eat
ONE

ever
Even
home
cook
could
make
better
this
won't

of

Where
to
start
A
perfect
example
of
why
you
should
be
checking
out
a
neighborhood

Once
inside
you'll
find
very
nice
set-up
perfectly
sized
bar
with
plenty

We

office
nightmare
Honestly
this
pace
is
a
key
shop
Nothing
sexy
about
it
but
I
wanted
to
give
these
guys
some
major
Yelp
props
came
here
get
few
keys
made
for
my
apartment
mailbox
and
pool
was
literally
out
the
door
in
ten
minutes
No
messing
around
just
straight
business
Which
fine
by
me
because
don't
know
you
really
want
spend
spare
time
hanging
This
place
has
a
little
drink
called
The
Bowtie
and
it's
absolutely
amazing
A
must
if
you're
in
the
area
Rosewood
Chinese
cuisine
is
pretty
good
Good

the

itself
beautiful

and
food
was
Some
of
Dim
Sum
items
like
Shrimp
rice
roll
蝦卷
a
bit
larger
than
your
typical
shrimp
roll
It
ashamed
that
they
don't
serve
with
carts
You
know
you're
calling
cart
ladies
to
come
over
putting
at
table
it's
fun
But
serves
cooked
in
order
Besides
kind
small
However
just
over
past
week
has

My
hubby
brought
me
here
to
try
their
Montreal
style
bagels
but
they
were
just
ok
While
we
there
also
had
falafel
and
chicken
shawarma
I
wouldn't
recommend
that
anyone
Falafel
was
awful
in
fact
the
worst
have
ever
eaten

could
taste
stale
oil
it
fried
in
completely
flavourless
Not
recommended

Location
Not

area
sit

gets
super
crowded
inside
therefore
something
like
long
bar

outside
mind
eating
standing
up
least
surface
can
put
plate
while
eat
way
separate
ordering
areas
by
meat...please
get
rid
this
It
causes
confusion
unnecessary
extra
one
type
taco
Instead
three
stations
mulitas
etc
Also
directing
go
witnessed
her
running
out
telling
them
line
too
long
do

steal
into

only

it
love
Mexico
having

cool
Overall
return
next
time
visit
Las
Vegas
We
live
in
the
neighbourhood
but
only
thought
to
check
out
this
restaurant
because
we
received
a
flyer
mail
were
also
enticed
try
of
free
delivery
Ordered
Deluxe
and
Hawaiian
pizzas
pizza
bread
1
lb
medium
wings
Pizza
was
extremely
thin
crust
which
I
love
you're
not
getting
full
on
empty
carbs
toppings
quite
loaded
made
for
an
authentic
taste
Wings
great
deal
at

10
wings

can't
go
wrong
with
that
bit
letdown
had
ordered
it
some
past
reviews
mentioned
as
delicious
appetizer
found
rather
bland...literally
like
eating
crust
given
complimentary
potato
soup
think
so
that
nice
touch
flavourful
Delivery

from
time

Found
kind

Overall
overall
experience

later
it's
better
order
our
usual
Domino's
yeah
Grandview
salon
is
a
solid
spot
on
the
Mount
The
food
selection
leaves
little
something
to
be
desired
They
have
menu
that
needs
overhaul
This
place
could
do
better
in

To
talk

In

I
would

elsewhere
Clean

and
nice
friendly
staff
I
love
that
you
can
see
the
cooks
making

with

Chili

more

Old
Montreal
joints
Unfortunately
Fullerton
was
NOT
cooperative
and
tried
very
hard
to
scam
us
The
contractor's
board
forced
them
redo
the
carpet
They
brought
out
7
different
people
that
I
wouldn't
open
my
front
door
had
they
been
going
door
It
took
months
months
installer
errors
were
from
Tony's
work
as
he
did
drawings
for
install
baseboards
personally
be
redone
incorrectly
installed
started
popping
loose
A
year
a
half
later
laminate
flooring
is
coming
up
in
many
places
There
unnecessary
transitions
put
due
him
not
knowing
specifications
over
cutting
our
frames
which
must
now
repaired
We
would
definitely
recommend
against
this
company
We
had
decided
to
eat
dinner
there
last
night
and
we
were
promptly
seated
even
though
our
reservation
wasn't
for
another
30
min
Everything
was
looking
great
smelling
great
But
then
after
seated
in
the
private
dinning
area
wine
racks
it
like
forgotton
The
waiter
came
took
drink
orders
my
parents
bottle
of
wine
He
returned
almost
10
minutes
later
with
water
glasses
left
didn't
receive
until
finally
able
grab
someone
passing
by
door
ask
water
That
over
20
minutes
And
came
It
nearly
30-35minutes
waters
too
so
thirsty
from
a
long
day
sun
out
order
check
on
us
once
that
40
min
recieve
food
ordered
My
father
little
brother
ordered
meat
rodizuo
all
you
can
meats
brought

Well
they
waited

recieved
plates
but
only
2
servers
served
them
just
chicken
wasnt

five
done
that
I
manager
service
ridizuo
orders
So
sit
wait
get
eat
bad
timing
You
would
think
that
paying
300
dinner
be
better
What
an
awefule
experince
have
when
hungry
hoping
is
expected
any
restaurant
been
better
at
dennys
This
place
is
amazing
The
women
who
work
there
are
fun
and
very
friendly
they
do
amazing
work
They
talk
to
you
before
sit
down
make
sure
on
the
same
page
start
cutting
I
was
super
hesitant
first
time
came
here
because
of
price
what's
a
20
haircut
really
going
look
like
but
I've
been
3
times
so
long
as
I'm
in
Charlotte
this
only
get
my
hair
cut
Absolutely
come
Ruth's
Came
with
a
bunch
of
friends
for
brunch
and
was
excited
to
try
this
place
out
The
menu
is
quite
extensive
the
wall
posts
several
daily
specials
staff
nice
gave
their
recommendations
any
help
needed
reason
2
stars
they
do
not
have
AC
It
kind
baffles
me
that
hipster
spot
downtown
would
Our
entire
group
very
uncomfortable
throughout
meal
could
enjoy
our
food
Ok
so
We
ordered
few
different
dishes
drinks
I
can
say
all
were
tasty
an
interestingly
fusion
Mexican
Asian
elements
Most
filling
except
waffles
which
came
two
small
pieces
I'll
be
honest
say
wanted
my
but
on
occasion
because
blazing
heat
I
recently
had
the
opportunity
to
have

I
had
2
quick
layovers
for
my
trip
to
and
from
Miami
I'm
really
glad
that
they
stopped
in
Phoenix
both
times
It's
not
often
you
find
decent
airport
food
but
La
Grande
Orange
definitely
altered
mindset
on
that
For
those
as
into
sandwiches
am
there
are
also
pizzas
burgers
salads
omelettes
gelato
soups
etc
My
girlfriend
got
the
Stacked
Turkey
Sandwich
times
were
equally
amazing
a
lover
of
all
sandwiches
this
was
unlike
any
I've
ever
had
The
contents
super
fresh
didn't
skim
anything
great
spot
grab
meal
prices
aren't
terrible
well
They
do
stop
making
quite
early
cooked
foods
available
until
closing
Highly
recommend
if
have

This
review
is
for
the
pharmacy
in

I
had
a
tooth
extracted
recently
and
along
with
my
antibiotics
was
prescription
Vicodin
not
aware
that
you
can
now
get
DUI
driving
under
influence
of
Vicodin
but
head
pharmacist
let
me
know
about
this
probably
would
have
driven
this
good
to
just

could

gone

Besides

area

Ok
I
just
want
to
start
off
by
saying
that
this
location
is
literally
a
destination
people
travel
come
to
People
always
say
they
go
Vegas
and
try
shake
shack
Knowing
this
you
would
think
the

have
exceptional
customer

This
not
case
I've
been
here
twice
with
two
different
both
times
were

One

everything

sucked
The

Some

you
may
find

Nevertheless
YUM

Okay

SPICY
SHRIMP

we
didn't
have

Where
else
can
stuff
people
such

food
less
than

want
tell
all
friends
time
keep
this
place
myself

I
found
my
new
favorite
nail
salon
recently
switched
salons
as
the
quality
declined
at
previous
salon
Riley
has
now
done
nails
twice
and
will
absolutely
not
go
anywhere
else
from
on
her
entire
staff
are
extemely
friendly
efficient
cleanest

have
been
in
Everthing
is
in
sanitized

technicians
very
knowledgeable
considerate
The
amazing
polish
holds
up
so
much
better
don't
chipping
or
peeling
like
did
with
also
had
to
wait
for
more
than
5
minutes
without
an
appointment
Defintely
recommended
I
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
place
never
really
travel
to
part
of
Calgary
because
it
is
quite
far
from
my
house
so
don't
know
the
area
well
This
a
watering
hole
for
friends
and
now
why
The
inside
place
actually
nice
here
surprise
party
on
Saturday
we
were

party
food
came

I'm

No

without
a
this

Other

point
out
that

here
hit-or-miss--that's
definitely
true
However
find
sort
of
thing
happens
with
about

I've
ever
gone

My

got
two

for
three
nights
and
we
each
ended
up
paying
around
40
The
are
average
a
little
on
the

side
But
didn't
go
to
Vegas
sleep
so
they
worked

Calling

Pros

On

Really
Close

rather

or
food
We
ordered
a
deep
dish
and
thin
crust
2
of
the
worst
pizzas
ever
The
crust
was
like
cheap
frozen
grocery
store
brand
cheese
rubbery
greasy
This
is
restaurant
to
avoid
wait
time
at
least
45
minutes
not
worth
it
Go
anywhere
else
Not
very
impressed
with
this
place
Set
up
is
a
little
weird
and
cluttered
The
cashier
was
not
friendly
Didn't
say
hello
or
thank
you
It's
like
he
stressed
out
by
being
busy
There
only
3
other
shoppers
in
the
entire
store
Don't
think
they'll
stay
open
for
too
long
Especially

Service
was
great
All
the
rolls
were
fresh
and
delicious
It
a
bit
dark
so
kinda
hard
to
see

I
would
love
come
back
again
try
more
rolls
Crowded
noisy
But
the
mussels
were
best
I
have
ever
had
Big
plump
tasty
Service
was
great
too
Well
located
by
Eaton
Centre
I
really
wanted
to
like
Bonterra
but
was
completely
underwhelmed
with
my
experience
there
My

started
the
Smoked

which
delicious
We
also
had

Duck

And

But
for

there's
many
better
options

The

are
amazing

nice
Love
going
here
package
prices
a
bit
high
in
my
opinion
but
I
am
from

where

cheap
Much
cheaper
than
here
Las

Staff
is
very
friendly
and
knowledgable
prices
are
also
fair
Check
this

out
support

You'll

I
saw
all
the
amazing

and
suggested
this
to
my
buddy
for
breakfast
The

was
terrific
Everyone
had
a

on
their
face
food
just
ok.It
8AM

ordered
2
scrambled

crispy

sausage
pancakes
browns
were
square

luke
warm

Vermont

pretty

Same
buddy's
browns
But
we
in
little
bit
of
hurry
only
ate
some
sausage
I'll
give
place
another
try
And
I'm
sure
our
waitress
would
have
corrected
issue
if
gave
her
chance
Some
people
tip
less
isn't
right
but
didn't
chance
correct
it
We
tipped
nicely
Super
awesome
place
I
had
the
goat

and
jalapeño
quesadilla
it
was
so
delicious
couldn't
believe
it
My

biscuits

Delicious

my
new

Great

The

need
major
work
service
ok
I
like
the
convenience
of
having
Starbucks
and
gift
shop
at
entrance
Had
a
2
bloody
mary
here
It
tasted
like
2
I
love
marys
with
kick
and
mine
definitely
had
one.They
just
need
to
tone
down
the
olive
juice
or
whatever
was
causing
that
rubbery
sour
flavor
their
decor
ambiance
friendly
service
I'll
give
them
another
try
maybe
mimosas
will
be
better
Best
Salon
in
Vegas/Henderson
I've
lived
Las
Vegas
for
11
years
and
have
tried
more
salons
than
I
can
count
but
never
found
a
salon
even
importantly
stylist
that
was
happy
with
Amber
Harlan
at
Hotbox
is
incredible
She
does
everything
from
fantastic

Keratin

me
my

everyone
else
the
are
so

it
feels
like
place
been
going

forever
just
by
way
they
treat
you
They
remember
when
call
make
an
appointment
always
offer
glass
of
wine
lemonade
sangria
iced

etc
The
warm
prices
extremely
reasonable

provided
STAR
wouldn't
dream
anywhere

It
may
taken
find
excellent

now
have
will
be
seeing
very
long
time
wish
could
give
her
5
stars
am
thrilled
with
salon
First
time
at
The
Mirage
Absolutely
loved
it
Top-quality
customer
service
ONLY
reason
why
I'm
giving
it
4
stars
is
because
the
casino
ate
my
money
But
what
should
one
expect
FYI
restaurants
inside
Mirage
were
fantastic
and
pool
was
spot
on
A
true
gem
of
kitch
and
hipster
trashiness
in
our
majestic
city
They
just
need
to
sort
out
their
hot
sauce
situation
Bring
back
the
different
flavors
Get
your
nacho
on
never
look
back
I
liked
this
place
overall
as
the
food
was
good
which
is
always
important

When
we
walked
in
on
a
Wednesday
were
told
there
long
wait
despite
empty
tables
As
soon
mentioned
going
to
Bakersfield
they
ran
after
us
say
table
had
suddenly
opened
That
bit
interesting
and
have
heard
others
same
experience
Are
trying
create
perception
of
popularity
Maybe
It
also
super
dark
so
kind
lost
track
what
time
it
was
Intentional
Probably
We
ordered
drinks
guac
The
guac
great
brought
extra
chips
when
out
Ordered
Korean
taco
Was
but
salty
Tacos
size
pretty
filling
Would
be
cool
if
you
could
mix
match
kinds
Overall
think
worth
visit
Do
NOT
use
these
people
They
are
horrible
Our
air
went
out
and
they
wouldn't
send
anyone
until
the
next
day
meanwhile
our
house
was
85
degrees
were
supposed
to
be
there
between
9-12
showed
up
at
11:55
checked
one
thing
said
it
a
dirty
filter
charged
us
50
bucks
The
day
we
came
home
from
work
again
When
I
called
them
again
told
me
no
could
come
that
didn't
say
anywhere
on
paperwork
should
have
run
diagnostic
check
got
forwarded
supervisor
she
raised
her
voice
kept
cutting
off
tell
wrong
wasn't
going
refunded
my
money
DO
USE
THESE
PEOPLE
Have
eaten
lots
of
middle
eastern
food
even
at
really
good
places
and
seriously
EVERYTHING
this
place
is
better
than
the
others,....and
some
others
are
good
There
something
about
quality
tastes
here
that
simply
surpass
others
Is
it
fancy
well
decorated
No
It's
in
a
corner
type
market
But
amazing
food
And
service
always
friendly
you
feel
like
part
family
Prices
Ridiculously
moderate/mainstream
for
what
get
Worst
thing
I
don't
get
to
eat
enough,.....oh
can't
exact
food
everywhere
any
moment

they've
ruined
me
on
anywhere
else
Winding

Pickles

nothing
really
speak

Breading

Cheese
awesome
If

make
these
at

I'd
whole

them
and
eat
while

Burger
pretty
good.....$16
good
Nah

it

Good

for

I
have
to
believe
that
this
is
generating
a
fair
portion
of
the
company's
revenue
I've
seen
people
walking
down

with
4-5
bright

Had

this

This

is
little
weird
as
you
have

Getting

Maybe
I

I'll
give

credit

they
FAST

5
minutes

saw
some

shocked
at

here
My

Started
with

Had

Stopped
in
for
brunch
on
the
weekend
with
my
grandfather
He
had
English
fry
up
and
I
this
breakfast
that
some
Spanish
influence
done
a
skillet
it's
cover
of
menu
Both
us
nothing
but
good
things
to
say
Service
was
great
food
delicious
drinks
cold
an
amazing
view
city
I
wish
could
say
this
place
was
worth
more
then
3
stars
especially
because
it's
one
of
the
few
nice
steakhouses
in
West
Valley
but
I've
never
had
an
all-around
great
meal
The
service
is
normally
good
don't
like
sitting
bar
area
as
that
where
many
servers
tend
to
gather
and
socialize
They
have
a
pretty
decent
happy
hour
with
quite
food
options
patio
if
not
too
hot
out
bad
steak
they
do
tremendous
filet
mignon
sides
are
just
mediocre
By
now
we've
tried
about
1/2
them
none
what
you
get
should
consider
cutting
down
on
amount
perfecting
them
Their
desserts
darn
good
celebrating
typically
bring
out
complimentary
Butter
Cake
It
excellent
coming
from
somebody
who
does
huge
sweet
tooth
Overall
place
plan
returning
future
Went
here
yesterday
and
the
place
is
awesome
Beer
brewed
in

so
can't
buy
it
anywhere
else
On

of
that

really
good
Waiters

This
a
I
would
tip
20
percent
Keep
up
Hey
so
I
enjoyed
this
place
alot
The
food
came
fast

had
the
pad
see
yew
medium
spice
will
say
it
seemed
a
little
more
spicy

Over
all
was
good
and
def
worth
second
look
love
Thai
is
on
return
to
list
Only
thing
didn't
like
much
how
difficult
can
be
get
your
waiters
attention

limited
but
great

cash
only

me
wrong
I
love
Gordon
Biersch

their

sucked

Pros

Cons
bad

request
No

Not
even
for
large
groups
Tips
if
you
go
a
group
people
make
sure
bring
cash
limited
strictly
the
bar
area
Sit
itself
quicker
not
surrounding

Make
take
advantage
it
heat
lamps
are
available
on
those
colder
Nevada
nights
Summerlin
GBs
has
way
better
I'm
just
saying
Overall

don't
think
I'll
be
returning
location
The
server
was
horrible
and
it
evident
that
she
having
day
She
did
smile
frustrated
whole
time
because
we
had
larger
party
We
tried
near
were
under
age
explained
closed
they
wanted
join
us
we'd
all

It's
disappointment
subpar
This
made
the

just
a
great
experience
pulling
everyone
together
and
being
goofy
all

And
service
Def
would
hire
them
for
any

My
first
balloon
was
so-so
then
I
found
Float
The
seemingly
minor
differences
made
for
an
entirely
superior
experience
will
be
recommending
Float
from
here
forward
All
of
my
co-workers
one
day
showed
up
for
working
noticeably
hungover

the

Laziza
The
next
week
I
decided
to
join
them
in
debauchery
Makeout

Laziza
is
epitomizes
all
that
a
hookah

should
be
dimly
lit
DJ

floor
which
night
was
vanity
rather

well-stocked

Our

I
believe

I'm
usually
not

hookah
but
every
time
hose
came
way
went

As

so
many

specials
My
coworker
disappointed
he
couldn't
partake
two

drinks
since
they
were

he'd
like

Also

However
I'll

It's
close

so
I
get

I
was
here
for
a
quick
business
trip
this
week
Coming
from
someone
that
spends
half
her
life
in
hotel
i
can
tell
you
is
one
of
the
best
hotels
i've
stayed
at
by
far
across
country
It
so
clean
and
housekeeping
great
Ashley
FOLDED
my
clothes
placed
them
on
bed
with
note
saying
i
had
great
style
mean
come
now
This
hotel
takes
customer
service
to
next
level
Not
mention
they
have
pool
waterfall
an
adorable
huge
lizard
slide
Great
families
too
I
finally
received
a
call
from
the
office
manager
Becky
today
One
of
RUDEST
people
have
ever
met
She
stated
that
as
far
she
was
concerned
there
no
malpractice
on
their
part
and
that
asked
her
why
charged
for
dental
cleaning
when
tooth
had
specifically
to
be
taken
out
infected
not
answer
Xray
Restraints
my
dog
under
anesthetic
at
time
X-ray

replied
Oh
they
must
forgotten
take

NO
BECKY
ADDED
it

They
also
added
Handling

Reading
Along
with
waste
disposal
which
been
few
teeth
fell
out
while
were
in
forgot
tell
me
about
Just
like
off
dogs
leg
bandages
so
wouldn't
swell
get
overnight
or
15
year
old
may
VERY
serious
problem
due
his
ALKP
blood
test
coming
back
2000
instead
normal

too
Becky
In

this

SHAME

HOSPITAL

Probably
the
best
steak
experience
I've
ever
had
in
my
life
We
decided
to
go
with
chef's
selection
domestic
wagyu
Best
deal
Start
warm
frisée
Caesar
salad
prosciutto
San
Daniele
and
shrimp
cocktail
Awesome
start
The
meat
Domestic
wagyu
filet
skirt
ribeye
They
ribeye
skirt
were
by
far
favorite
So
buttery
rich
I'm
not
much
of
a
filet
fan
because
it
lacks
fat
we
all
know
fat=flavor
Sides
Brussels
red
pepper
risotto
potato
purée
All
which
perfection
Dessert
monkey
bread
tropical
vanilla
cheesecake
trio
ice
cream
caramel
chocolate
mousse
By
this
point
there
been
so
food
that
I
think
meat
high
Overall
was
amazing
may
have
some
clogged
arteries
worth
it
Good
food
Complimentary
egg
noodles
are
soaking
in
grease
It's
noise
here
too
The
one
lady
there
always
shouts
out
to
the
kitchen
and
people
ordering
takeout
sit
at
tables
it's
an
awkward
stare
from
these
onlookers
while
you
dine
in
But
really
great
Just
might
be
better
ask
for
delivery
Beautiful
garden
and
glass
flowers
otherwise
nothing
special
Cleaning
lady
was
very
nice
did
a
good
job
Mini
bar
rip
off
there
no
space
to
put
our
own
bottles
or
food
in
fridge
So
my
friends
decided
take
out
few
mini
their
water
cool
down
for
hours
In
hours
hotel
sent
guy
check
on
bar
They
wanted
charge
300
items
that
were
not
used
just
because
they
misplaced
We
argued
while
only
after
we
talked
the
managed
removed
extra
charges
booked
out
To
be
honest
I
wasn't
thrilled
about
experience

I
just
wanted
to
share
my
previous
Luxor
experience
with
you
I'm
a
M-Life
client
and
was
really
excited
during
first
stay
at
up
until
check
out
time
yesterday
when
encountered
very
rude
sarcastic
employee
informed
AJ
Medina
Luxor
Supervisor
that
Wi-Fi
connection
did
not
work
see
if
there
anything
she
could
possibly
do
far
as
reducing
resort
fee
or
whatever
seemed
feasible
the
time
Ms
replied
no
am
going
adjust
your
didn't
because
you
stayed
in
east
tower
I
available
upon
time

kindly
pointed
Medina
colleague
Tracy
Childress
who
staying
next
door
sister
property
Excalibur
experienced
similar
issue
they
had
problem
comping
her
for
inconvenience
replied
sarcastically

highly
doubt
that
let
me
look
into
this
telling
truth
surprise
actually
took
it
herself
research
collogues
personal
information
not
sure
is
protocol
computer
system
In
conclusion
rectified
any
manner
whatsoever
simple
apology
would
have
even
sufficed
find
conduct
unprofessional
an
embarrassment
only
wife
on
receiving
end
but
overall
Very
good
happy
hour
but
service
was
just
god
awful
Water
always
empty
and
server
never
present
Maybe
after
20
minutes
of
waiting
we
finally
got
our
check
In
all
food
poor
service
Just
walked
out
of
this
place
two
minutes
ago
It
was
my
first
time
and
had
a
horrible
experience
I
no
idea
that
is
cash
only
place
after
completing
order
verbally
the
cashier
informed
only
I'm
starving
so
he
pointed
to
ATM
machine
inside
reluctantly
up
because
knew
there
would
fees
but
didn't
care
Sure
enough
see
message
on
screen
saying
dispensing
error
agreeing
pay
1.75
in
withdraw
20
Cash
did
not
dispense
got
print
clearly
showing
amount
deducted
from
account
also
logged
into
mobile
banking
app
it
showed
transaction
funds
been
pending
returned
him
app
basically
said
wait
for
3-5
days
For
refund
What
couldn't
believe
response
Later
their
machine
It's
your
damn
property
inside
restaurant
care
Typical
rude
unprofessional
service
gangnam
style
Forget
DO
NOT
use
ATM
Cozy
place
Stopped
in
for
a
drink
on
Friday
night
It
was
busy
but
not
packed
Decent
beer
menu
Not
ton
of
seating
wouldn't
bring
large
group
there
There's
bar
table
and
few
seats
at
the
windows
Service
good
Gets
loud
there
when
it's
busy
Music
playing
you
couldn't
hear
it
very
well
over
chattering
lively
groups
Would
love
to
try
food
reviews
look
fab
Very
solid
brick
oven
pizza
Some
of
the
best
pizza
crust
I
have
had
We
also
had
Greek
salad
that
was
very
fresh
and
lively
Service
friendly
attentive
The
atmosphere
basic
strip
mall
but
food
made
up
for
that
Great
find
Went
there
with
a
colleague
Been
before
This
place
is
real
100
Halal
and
quality
freshness
guaranteed
Meticulously
prepared
The
best
Hakka
food
anywhere
Better
than
I
had
in
Taiwan
Must
haves
Manchurian
noodle
OMG
Bombay
chicken
are
my
two
personal
faves
spiiiiicy
Get
out
the
Kleenex

your
sinuses
will
be
happy
They
do
things
right
here
Love
love

rea$onably
priced
Massive
portions
bursting
flavour
their
mussels
black
bean
sauce
AHHHH
I'm
obsessed
with
the
iced
dirty
chai
Yum
Also
Denver
scramble
is
quite
delicious
It's
a
quaint
and
friendly
local
coffee
spot
I
might
be
addicted
Please
check
them
out
Also
hear
their
cinnamon
rolls
are
to
DIE
for
haven't
tried
it
yet
because
love
my
scramble
This
restaurant
is
not
bad
and
it's
definitely
great
for
the
Fremont
area
but
Pin
Kaow
Thai
better
The
pad
see
ew
was
way
too
sweet
drinks
over
priced
service
so
great
I
came
a
birthday
party
they
permitted
us
to
make
reservation
because
there
six
of
us
we
still
didn't
get
seated
until
an
hour
after
our
time
Then
at
counter
that
faced
wall
couldn't
communicate
with
each
other
We
could
only
hear
person
next
us
Who
seats
like
that
Kind
service
Clean
artsy
feel
Im
so
excited
to
find
a
really
good
Italian
spot
nearby
Fresh
pasta
So
yummy
They
charged
1
do
Alfredo
instead
of
tomato
sauce
Cheesy
bread
is
buttery
and
soft
Love
their
German
Riesling
Spent
55
for
two
at
lunch
time
I
will
usually
give
a
place
second
chance
but
Danny
Boys
won't
be
getting
that
chance
The
food
had
was
overpriced
and
wasn't
good
This
takeout
ordered
what
thought
would
easy
An
appetizer
of
tater
tots

bland
Pepperoni
pizza
for
me
couldn't
find
the
pepperonis
pie
swimming
in
sauce
My
roommate
Italian
cobb
salad
found
it
all
very
tasteless
Add
to
bland/bad
are
outrageously
high
prices
we
got
just
makes
sure
going
back
again
Even
staff
were
there
didn't
seem
enthusiastic
There
line
people
picking
up
take
out
orders
after
giving
name
ignored
until
our
order
came
up
A
couple
left
without
their
because
they
wait
too
long
With
other
restaurants
area
is
last
on
my
list
places
go
Absolutely
love
this
place
The
staff
is
always
kind
and
very
helpful
This
a
great
place
to
hang
out
having
chat
over
latte
or
sitting
reading
book
in
one
of
the
large
comfortable
chairs
they
have
corner
Oh
Nord
sandwich
To
die
for
I
also
took
picky
Frenchman(my
boyfriend
for
breakfast
here
he
particular
about
his
quiche
when
it
arrived
was
satisfied
Not
too
bad
for
a
quick
lunch
but
I've
had
much
better
the
same
price
or
less
Menus
are
greasy
silverware
does
not
inspire
confidence
either

use
chopsticks
Food
is
ok
they
drown
it
in
sauce
even
though
I
asked
to
be
on
dry
side
Can't
remark
anything
special
as
nothing
stood
out
I
like
this
store
because
it's
a
place
feel
not
too
many
people
know
about
or
take
advantage
of
They
have
wine
and
beer
selection
that
you
won't
normally
find
at
grocery
most
bars
also
frequent
tastings
Do
not
go
here
anymore
I
live
in
the
neighborhood
and
went
to
get
to-go
food
they
have
decided
change
prices
on
everything
was
charged
25
cents
for
each
ITEM
ordered
as
a
fee
This
place
had
really
gone
down
hill
since
Edgar
left
there
are
always
young
kids
bartending
who
ignore
customers
their
friends
at
bar
drinking
I'm
sad
see
what
has
happened
this
place
Terrible
Customer
Service
As
I
was
driving
past
the
store
saw
a
huge
sign
in
window
advertising
buy
1
get
free
on
wiper
blades
With
my
wipers
falling
to
pieces
and
monsoon
storms
looming
thought
it
would
be
good
idea
buy
some
After
picked
specific
brand
up
declined
upgrading
performance
blades
that
were
not
but
1
funny
enough
informed
that
sale
effect
until
tomorrow
Having
worked
retail
before
is
common
practice
for
misrepresented
most
often
from
display
being
left
too
long

this
case
displayed
prematurely
overridden
by
manager
The
computer
programmed
sale
complete
bullshit
A
manager
can
override
anything
His
only
solution
come
back
tomorrow
No
thanks
Wiper

Sudden
storm

Danger
bought
at
full
price
will
tomorrow
return
re-buy
them
just
mess
with
their
daily
merch
numbers
But
if
doesn't
take
pride
taking
care
of
customers
can't
imagine
they
much
else
I
like
the
atmosphere
but
service
is
absolutely
horrible
The
waitresses
were
drunk
or
Hi
on
something
sorry
it
shouldn't
take
15
minutes
to
put
beer
and
ice
in
a
bucket
slow
night
Good
to
see
the
west
side
of
town
get
a
good
local
coffee
shop
Coffee
was
great
and
aesthetic
is
on
point
place
work
bring
laptop
Pacific
Mall
is
known
to
have
chaotic
parking
situations
So
I
try
avoid
this
place
and
would
only
go
if
need
something
specific
Because
find
that
for
the
other
things
people
could
buy
here
like
bubble
tea
Chinese
food
pastries
baked
goods
they
can
easily
get
somewhere
else
without
having
deal
with
frustrating
situation
one
purpose
which
cellphone
screen
protectors
them
installed
me
As
has
lots
of
these
stores
just
pick
them
For
cases
phone
accessories
on
eBay
same
case
costs
3
eBay
28
here
so
why
bother
Prices
are
expensive
side
most
stores
don't
place
be
a
bargain-hunter's
dream
On
rare
occasion
visit
Mall
always
make
sure
come
by
2nd
floor
some
Pinoy
Waffles
as
love
their
really
fresh
2-3
minute
wait
Over-all
good

Great
coffee
and
pastries
some
of
the
baristas
make
best
cappuccinos
around
Madison
area
The
ambiance
is
great
they
have
free
Wi-Fi
It's
a
hot
or
miss
here
The
adobo
pancit
beef
dishes
are
fairly
decent
Sometimes
you'll
get
scoop
of
boney
meat
and
hardly
any
protein
to
keep
one
satiated
Just
under
8
I
can
2
dish
combo
with
rice
good
for
decent
lunch
would
advise
against
seafood
items
they
have
offer
just
not
idea
sit
long
periods
in
warmers
tried
the
squid
again
stay
away
Per
usual
meats
on
skewers
too
sweet
my
liking
but
majority
beg
differ
They
charge
nominal
fee
if
order
is
10

Not
big
deal
you're

Conveniently

there's
plenty

Interesting
place
to
stop
by
I
grew
up
with
TZ
so
knew
all
of
these
statues
Going
in
Bally's
didn't
see
one
sign
for
this
had
ask
It's
downstairs
a
few
other
misc
shops
Jeff
and
his
staff
were
extremely
helpful
took
care
of
me
very
well
Their
prices
are
great
the
service
was
excellent
shipping
FAST
This
is
just
first
many
orders
that
I
plan
to
do
with
them
highly
recommend
for
your
printing
needs
What
an
amazing
experience
At
first
we
were
hesitant
after
reading
prior
reviews
that
said
the
lobby
smelled
like
farts
However
was
far
from
case
My
fiancé
and
I
celebrating
our
engagement
staff
very
accommodating
Not
only
did
they
take
us
on
a
private
tour
of
restaurant
but
surprised
with
cake
congratulating
special
evening
The

outstanding

Great

nice

Go
here
to
have
a
long
dinner
Good
high
quality
food
This
place
is
like
something
out
of
a
bad
movie
Never
been
to
New
York
but
I
can
imagine
it
there
Nice
selection
porn
and
other
parafanilia
in
the
booths
nor
have
ever
came
here
alone
It's
no
facinations
tiff
seems
it
Alton's
is
great
Everything
I've
tried
from
their
pork
chops
ribs
salad
steak
appetizers
have
all
been
amazing
It's
a
great
place
for
nice
dinner
date
night
etc
First
I
want
to
say
that
may
come
back
and
revise
this
review
because
I'm
pregnant
so
won't
be
reviewing
the

but
food
had
AZ

with
onion

My

The
buns
were
pretzel
smaller

It

I've
at

bland
feel
they
depended
on
drizzle
of

give
rest
ingredients
flavor
a
bit

it
was
good

place
known
for
one
thing
only
its
famous
fried
Oreo's
and
Twinkies
Something
I've
been
dying
to
try
Maybe
sweets
were
calling
me
or
my
curiosity
of
secret
where
they
deep
fry
oreos
twinkies
that
brought
here
What
ever
it
was
lets
just
say
time
adventure
Twinkies

Oreos
This
was
favorite
on

not
exactly
what
accepted
CASH

You
owe
it
to
your
self
give
them
try
Good
ramen
relaxing
atmosphere
Menu
could
use
some
more
items
just
my
opinion
The
black
garlic
ramen
was
amazing
and
has
kept
me
coming
back
I
also
recently
tried
the
midori
basil
might
like
it
even
than
ramen
This
is
a
Sweet
Tomatoes
no
more
or
less
The
facility
maybe
little
nicer
than
many
It
tried
to
turn
into
one
of
the
new
bistro
locations
and
remodeled
but
abandoned
that
concept
with
every
else
Still
nice

try
to
remember
my
overall
experience
lol
So
we
arrived
around
7:20pm
on
Friday
night
and
I
anticipated
wait-time
but
when
got
there
there
was
long
line
of
people
The
hostess
informed
us
it
would
be
about
1-1
1/2
hour
wait
We
drove
all
the
way
from
Brampton
so
said
ok
we'll
cool
thing
is
they
take
your
phone
number
down
then
text
is
sent
confirm
wait...then
table
ready
you
get
another
have
10
min
table
think
it's
good
idea
case
don't
want
wait
cold
as
really
isn't
waiting
area
In
exactly
an
hour
our
ready

Anything

Everything

If
you're

downside
this

bit
small
They
do

not

too
Also

if
shell/nut

Food
is
absolutely
delicious
The

soo

and
the

was
awesome
restaurant
has
a
very
comfortable
environment
service
wonderful
Our
bartender
Ciara
did
an
amazing
job
taking
care
of
us
had
perfect
recommendations
on
what
to
eat
drink...she's
There
is
quality
in
their
product
I
usually
just
do
my
eyebrows
and
after
getting
them
done
here
it's
well
worth
it
Twice
the
price
but
are
much
more
groomed
so
can
go
a
little
bit
longer
inbetween
sessions
Highly
recommend
Great
food
and
great
service
Very
hearty
breakfast
The
wait
times
are
long
but
that
comes

I
suppose
We've
been

we'll
be
back
again
for
sure
They
just
relocated
to

vaughan
near

awesome

made

big

and
very
good

I
always
have
breakfast
dinner
With
their
fresh
salad
commercials
playing
every
minute
on
TV
I
thought
I'd
try
Wendy's
new
salads
Not
worth
the
detour
This
is
same
prepackaged
type
of
that
you'd
get
from
a
McDonald's
rather
pay
3-4
dollars
more
and
real
fresh
salad
And
for
rest
food...well
it's
Wendy's
so
if
your
into
junk
food
they
are
as
good
others
better
or
worse
Then
say
offer
free
wifi
but
tried
connecting
it
didn't
work
asked
help
no
one
really
seemed
to
care
A
woman
with
red
shirt
came
out
she
might
have
been
manager
She
any
additional
kind
shrugged
me
off
nuisance
interrupting
normal
flow
whatever
was
occupying
her
time

She

It's
cute

I
am
only
giving
this
review
2
stars
for
the
comfortable
bed
The
first
and
most
annoying
thing
about
visit
was
misrepresentation
of
hotel
had
booked
trip
through
hotels.com
There
no
mention
whole
second
part
building
which
included
club
scene
little
cafe
whatever
else
attached
In
photos
advertised
it
a
beautiful
cheap
room
booking
Instead
nightmare
visit
It
all
began
with
registration
unprofessional
set
up
they
call
desk
checking
in
looked
like
community
potluck
table
until
realized
where
we
were
in
Had
problems
taller
lady
at
she
nice
direct
issues
customer
service
After
finally
directed
us
how
to
get
our
rooms
This
is
when
confused
We
not
given
hotel
for
walk
past
pool
onto
foulest
smelling
elevator
that
felt
as
if
would
fall
plummeting
me
my
death
every
time
moved
Once
stepping
off
greeted
carpet
thought
designed
dark
strip
down
middle
then
just
dirty
ill
maintained
When
entered
wanted
wind
down
went
turn
on
lights
but
out
3
lamps
been
plugged
1
wasn't
even
close
an
outlet
placed
there
cord
leading
nowhere
while
nearest
outlet
minimum
6
ft
away
also
other

work
Are
real
go
ice
couldn't
find
machine
6th
floor
Not
wanting
look
around
floors
aimlessly
tried
directory
show
could
it
one
stupid
tower
Clearly
annoyed
front
what
surprise
phone
Which
from
previous
now
read
due
get
way
experince
its
guests
have
resolved
But
hey
tower
jumping

ask
directions
ice
do
disturb
put
door
so
housekeeping
woke
9:30
am
floor
obviously
hadn't
swept

My
feet
black
after
taking
couple
steps
changing
Paint
peeling
walls

Signs
parking
lot
are
terribly
marked
shared
by
club
paid
knowing
before
hand
supply
pass
lost
more
money
entire
place
dated
smelled
death
cleaned
enough
impress
queen
dust
mites
mildew
overall
experience
awful
wouldn't
recommend
anyone
stay
here
unless
you
hate
yourself
college
student
who
doesn't
care
quality
anything
So
grateful
that
Dr
Jay
Suaverdez

Estrella
Falls
Dentistry
referred
me
to
Michael
Thompson
for
my
root
canal
procedure
is
arguably
the
greatest
endodontist
I
have
come
across
in
entire
54
years
of
life
I
literally
feel
like
was
just
treated
a
dental
procedure
by
Jordan
his
profession
Not
ever
wish
upon
anyone
but
if
and
when
you
do
experience
this
issue
look
no
further
than
cure

God
Bless

State
Farm
Great
tasting
cupcakes
at
a
pretty
reasonable
price
They
are
moist
and
taste
good
even
day
after
purchasing
one
Definitely
worth
visiting
if
you
stay
in
or
around
the
Venetian
One
of
my
favorite
places
but
last
night
I
was
very
disappointed
Our
server
didn't
greet
herself
so
don't
even
know
her
name
we
had
found
hair
in
our
food
course
asked
for
and
she
simply
said
Oh
I'm
sorry
did
not
get
the
manager
or
anything
to
fix
problem
usually
easy
going
seriously
customer
service
TERRIBLE
especially
how
nice
restaurant
is
supposed
be
price
Definitely
won't
returning
Five
stars
Great
service
Joseph
was
our
server
that
night
and
one
of
the
best
fine
dining
restaurant
rotating
restaurant
with
a
breathtaking
view
at
Sin
City
I
would
recommend
it
I
called
for
an
appointment
and
they
got
me
in
immediately
The
atmosphere
is
very
calming
relaxing
music
soft
lighting
exotic
fish
swimming
saltwater
aquariums
a
pedicure
gel
manicure
Neither
one
has
chipped
it's
been
2
WEEKS
will
be
returning
Longer
wait
time
but
the
food
came
quickly
Not
best
phad
Thai
ever
still
decent
enough

Portions
and
sauce
were
perfect
But
missing
a
lot
of
key
ingredients
Might
try
curry
next
Sushi
is
my
favorite
meal
and
THIS

MY
FAVORITE

TIPS
Come
for
dinner
to
get
the
good
AYCE

Menu
encompasses
one
order

person
It's
nice
that
not
everyone
at
your
table
needs
AYCE
Came
early
avoid
rush
There's
many
tables
inside
so
if
you
here
later
you'll
be
waiting
a
while

the
food
was
great
bar

as
I

The

If

me

I
loved
the

overall
atmosphere
of
this
place
The

are
also
very
polite
food
arrives
on
a

basis
Okay
but
main
reason
why
you
come
to
restaurant..the
though
was
pretty
nasty
Now
I'm
not
sushi
expert
or
anything
given
price
place
I
didn't
get
AYCE
you'd
expect
be
just
tad
bit
better
than
average
it
really
wasn't
Actually
even
if
did
AYCE
still
worth
it
got
shrimp
tempura
which
overly
fried
kind
stale
miso

slightly
watered

likewise
for

were
probably
only
redeeming
factor
meal
Personally
fan
despite
lovely
patio
won't
coming
back
iPad
cool
all
enough
make
me
want
Robert
was
a
Godsend
Unfortunately
we
hired
someone
else
first
and
ended
up
with
TV
on
the
floor
4
holes
in
wall
when
mount
pulled
out
of
wall
came
next
day
patched
figured
way
to
hang
our
safely
securely
He
so
friendly
kind
whole
time
Pricing
fair
job
done
reasonable
amount
So
glad
found
him
fix
else's
mistakes
everything
was
sooo
fresh
and
the
service
great
Fresh
organic
apple
juice
to
go
with
chop
n
chick
crowded
I
know
why
food
is
impeccable
cooked
perfectly
They
really
make
you
feel
welcome
and
at
home
here
care
about
the
quality
of
their
service
for
that
reason
I
will
be
coming
back
Oh
ambiance
is
superb
they
have
a
good
variety
delicious
food
Thanks
Sonata's
providing
an
exceptional
experience
This
store
is
one
of
my
frequent
places
to
grab
protein
supplements
hygiene
products
and
whatever
else
catches
eye
The
only
drawback
here
the
number
panhandler's
wantaprenuer's
peddling
mixtapes
knock
off
cologne,and
course
pushing
a
stroller
that
happens
have
cooler
loaded
with
snacks
for
sale
I
had
asked
for
quotes
from
8
junk
movers
Emanuel
was
quick
to
respond
and
quoted
the
lowest
rate
His
rate
included
everything
Drive
time
labor
disposal
He
also
able
come
next
day
work
with
time
frame
needed
When
he
came
kind
professional
took
more
than
originally
without
a
charge
simple
items
nothing
large
highly
recommend
him
will
never
ask
quote
another
company
again

Insane
I
have
been
going

at

I
love

My

know
it
parents

my
waking
hours
listening
and

When
told
bring

they
absolutely
could
not
believe
They

It

The

even
though
I've
shopped

TAKE
MY
ADVICE
I
SAW

If
you
care

artist
I've
been
to
This
my
second
ever
done
and
he
made
me
feel
at
home
I
would
recommend
going
to
him
because
there
no
other
like
him
When
come
back
charlotte
I'm
get
another
one
Thanks
from
Derrick
I
was
hoping
for
a
local
joint
to
add
my
list
but
no
such
luck
out
with
couple
of
friends
one
from
large
Mexican
family
recommended
the
place
since
we
were
in
area
Going
that
and
fact
it
seemed
pretty
busy
said
what
heck
We
could've
done
better
Once
our
waitress
finally
arrived
she
friendly
enough
little
overwhelmed
The
chips

salsa
followed
completely
underwhelmed
Bland
factory
um
you
say
Really
added
2
cups
spicy
sauce
just
give
some
taste
Didn't
me
warm/fuzzies
With
plenty
interesting
menu
options
went
tacos
pescado
One
word
dull
Almost
overloaded
dry
bland
chunks
mahi-mahi
huge
pile
rice
beans
each
flavor
didn't
taste
chipotle
cream
sauce
splashed
them
spicier
sauce
black
pepper
still
nothing
My
other
1st
timer
friend
later
told
he
felt
same
about
his
entree
like
he'd
eaten
big
chimi
on
side
can
see
why
is
busy
grub
American
belly
price
I'm
sure
relatives
from
Minnesota
would
say
oh

gosh
darn
good
yabetchya
But
it's
kinda
food
don't
want
goes
ka-thunk

A

him
Los
Sombreros
Mmmmm...mmmm
Very
crowded
table
They
gave
up
a
2
top
and
there
were
3
people
Then
they
forgot
half
our
order
And
I
know
it's
Friday
but
the
place
smelled
like
fish
Terrible
service
and
rude
salesman...He
got
upset
with
our
kids
sitting
on
the
furniture
Ummm...its
a
furniture
store
you
try
out

Well
done

Special

My

I
had
a

was
kind
enough
to
take
me
Bartolotta
A
foodie
friend
familiar
with
all
hot
spots
in
Vegas
recommended
it
II
read
many
reviews
on
Yelp
before
we
went
very
high
expectations
about
this
place
told
the
waiter
right
off
bat
not
disappointed
Neither
nor
interested
dead
fish
tray
wanted
want
but
it
did
appeal
We
started
Ligurian
octopus
salad
which
excellent
If
weren't
for
glowing
woulnd
have
ordered
it
So
thank
you
everyone
out
there
who
takes
time
write
these

Then

outstanding
sheep's

almost
3
hours
no

us
Our
primary
server
difficult
understand
first
because
he
mumbled
thankfully
perked
up
as
evening
wore
on
delight
from
start
finish
Overall
wonderful
dinning
experience
Only
draw
back
is
price
It
crazy
expensive
Four
small

1

4
classes
wine
not
most
expensive
ones
list
set
my
250
That's
lot
money
even
if
it's
food
Have
been
going
to
this
place
for
years
This
time
was
not
that
good
Ownership
changed
and
the
food
quality
went
down
Food
lacked
in
flavor
presentation
No
longer
recommending
family
friends
We
started
our
day
at
the
North
Las
Vegas
Premium
Outlet
and
I
saved
my
stomach
just
for
this
arrived
around
12:48
PM
we
were
led
to
a
table
right
away
It
wasn't
extremely
busy
but
most
tables
occupied
ordered
hot
cafe
mocha
spicy
chicken
chipotle
pasta
lunch
special
white
chocolate
raspberry
truffle
also
served
with
complimentary
breadsticks
They
warm
great
munch
on
before

The
mocha
was
large
nothing
too
spectacular
regarding
flavour
standard
mocha
smelled
delicious
when
it
arrived
added
some
Parmesan
cheese
top
crispy
tortilla
chips
an
extra
crunch
dish
enjoyed
it
flavourful
had
nice
kick
There
pieces
of
asparagus
green
peas
add
little
dish
However
thought
itself
firm
would
have
been
better
if
they
softer
took
long
time
decide
which
cheesecake
get
because
so
many
After
much
contemplation
settled
truffle

The

I
wouldn't
work
with
any
other
Realtor
in
the
Ahwatukee
area
Whether
you're
selling
your
home
or
buying
one
you'll
be
ecstatic
about
results
For
a
place
that
so
boldly
states
Ramen
as
part
of
their
name
It's
ironic
there
are
no
ramen
anywhere

So
if
you
reminiscing
gulping
down
tasty
wavy
ramen
don't
come
here
Otherwise
will
find
yourself
staring
at
bowl
spaghetti
in
soup
and
wondering
what
went
wrong
When
did
all
noodles
become
substitute
each
other
I
was
sure
stepped
into
not
an
Italian
noodle
I
was
pretty
impressed
with
Radish
They
have
a
great
looking
menu
many
interesting
salads
went
opening
day
and
the
service
spot
on
as
if
they
had
been

months

The
chicken
smoky
tasty
cheese
complimented
it
nicely
and
oh
ya
were
vegetables
dressing
also
very
tasty
their
kale
juice
which
thought
might
be
little
gross
but
surprisingly
tasty
I'll
back
Good
old
Yelp
to
the
rescue
again
On
a
recent
trip
Vegas
we
wanted
avoid
strip
and
busy
tourist
areas
found
Rock'N'oodles
I
had
expected
it
be
ramen
joint
from
name
but
they
so
many
delicious
pasta
choices
ended
choosing
Paradise
City
chicken
Alfredo

got
half
portion
which
was
only
8
more
than
enough
for
me
My
friends
taco
dish
an
Asian
noodle
all
devoured
everything
The
staff
courteous
attentive
I'd
definitely
go
back
The
gentlemen
that
works
the
desk
in
grooming
department
is
sooooooo
rude
I
know
he
took
a
job
with
animals
but
needs
lessons
on
customer
service
can
not
believe
PETCO
lets
someone
like
work
their
place
After
being
rude
has
audacity
to
even
say
see
you
next
appointment
will
never
bring
my
dog
there
and
recommend
anyone
ever
there
hope
they
start
hiring
employees
have
great
knowledge
loves
then
people

Shop

Ive
come
to
the
conclusion
that
most
Cirque
shows
are
same
Weird
and
amazing
acrobatics
with
creepy
humor
thrown
in
The
thing
about
this
one
is
there
a
moving
stage
Not
as
good
O
but
good
I
think
you
need
be
buzzed
or
high
either
really
enjoy
show
just
tripping
so
badly
run
out
of
screaming
Either
way
times
The
waitress
was
very
nice
vegan
tacos
omg
not
my
thing

I
told
the
and
she
offered
to
get
me
another
dish
which
appreciate
but
didn't
want
be
disappointed
again
My
sister
friend
enjoyed
their
meals
said
5
stars
for
king
crab
mini
tacos
This
is
an
odd
location
for
amazing
thai
food
If
you
don't
like
it
too
hot
stick
with
a
1
or
maybe
2
on
the
scale
3
to
5
might
kill
you
I
went
in
for
my
first
Brazilian
wax
at
the
Body
Waxing
studio
and
it
was
a
great
experience
Everyone
really
friendly
even
though
running
late
they
worked
with
me
to
still
accommodate
me
The
tech
gentle
talked
through
process
very
happy
made
another
appointment
before
left
highly
recommend

Beautiful
restaurant
I'm
visiting
Vegas
with
my
husband
and
parents
We
are
staying
at
the
cosmopolitan
came
here
for
a
quick
drink
before
hitting
roulette
The
bathrooms
located
outside
of
Service
bar
was
great
I've
been
going
to
Woodlands
for
something
like
15
years
It
is
by
far
the
best
Indian
food
I
have
ever
had
anywhere
lived
Every
time
come
Charlotte
try
go
get
my
fix
It's
hard
pick
a
favorite
dish
there
Order
appetizer
sampler
and
anything
else
all
truly
delicious
This
is
one
of
our
favorite
local
spots
Don't
let
the
negative
reviews
deter
you
We
have
breakfast
here
at
least
once
a
month
and
always
received
good
service
so
whatever
kinks
there
may
been
point
all
worked
out
The
people
who
own
restaurant
are
incredibly
friendly
nice
as
staff
Not
to
mention
great
French
cafe
ambience
But
enough
about
service
ambience
test
really
FOOD
And
food
delicious
We've
tried
practically
everything
on
menu
it's
safe
say
good
A
couple
true
highlights
eggs
benedict
salmon
BLT

some
best
in
valley
So
go
give
Emily's
chance
just
for
your
enjoyment
but
help
keep
this
spot
open
because
tough
location
needs
more
customers
Amazing
food
and
friendly
welcome
The
Pair
of
Dogs
may
be
the
best
hot
dog
my
life
Flavor
packed
links
perfectly
rendered
bacon
in
fresh
bun
Mmmm~Mmmm
I
struck
gold
with
this
place.....I
must've
come
at
a
good
time
because
was
seated
very
quickly
and
given
several
menus
to
decide
from
what
order
Apparently
the
two
places
are
owned
by
same
person
so
instantly
knew
that
someone
doing
something
right
wasn't
in
mood
for
burger
stepped
out
of
my
comfort
zone
ordered
miso
soup
Hell
if
know
soup
but
it
best
after
drinking
meal
ever
had
life
So
no
shame
game
when
picked
bowl
up
finish
off
Prices
were
adequate
rest
restaurants
Vegas
although
decor
so
spent
majority
looking
lol
strongly
recommend
little
gem
My
son
and
I
stopped
in
after
Indians
game
Was
not
crowded
was
seated
right
away
food
came
a
few
minutes
later
we
ordered
We
both
ordered
the
Summer
chicken
It
very
good
sandwich
would
get
again
as
for
fries
give
them
thumbs
down
don't
like
my
fries
burnt
to
me
they
were
over
cooked
crunchy
coleslaw
well
am
person
so
it
no-go
but
all
pretty
sandwich
Yuck
The
food
was
incredibly
bad
I
got
the
eggs
benedict
and
my
husband
country
fried
steak
Both
tasted
disgusting
We
also
a
pancake
wished
we
hadn't
syrup
nothing
like
syrup
is
over
priced
considering
it
tastes
so
bad
isn't
fresh
at
all
charged
4.95
for
small
bowl
of
fruit
that
really
warm
to
touch
Don't
understand
how
this
place
stays
in
business
Pure
nastiness
Best
calamari
I've
ever
had
Pizza
and
pasta
was
awesome
Chef
Franco
came
out
chatted
with
us
He's
a
real
nice
guy
LOVE
the
poutine
Yes
I
know
place
looks
kinda
sketchy
but
food
is
great
The
service
isnt
too
bad
either
and
prices
are
decent
Tip
small
poutine
more
than
enough
for
one
person
Game
Zone
has
fair
pricing
and
a
unique
inventory
They
are
the
only
local
shop
I
can
think
of
that
carries
imported
video
games
If
they
don't
have
product
want
owner
always
offers
to
order
it
for
me
been
shopping
here
since
was
little
kid
will
continue
forever
After
seeing
the
numerous
reviews
for

I
HAD
to
give
it
a
try
It
was
pleasant
Friday
August
evening
and
luckily
rain
stayed
away
since
Darren
had
wait
outside
nearly
an
hour
before
table
opened
up
The
owner

of
establishment
did
keep
checking
on
us
gave
updates
how
much
longer
he
thought
we'd
have
wait
There
is
menu
posted
restaurant
doors
we
plenty
time
mull
over
Once
seated
were
happy
already
our
mind
made
up
as
what
wanted
eat
wasted
no
giving
server

We
started
with
Steak

One
of
the
few

exactly
as
it
looks
on
website
Stoked
new
menu
options
are
tomorrow
They
also
serve
Xanadu
coffee
which
is

The
worst
service
that
I
have
ever
had
in
my
life
We
got
one
beer
an
hours
time
and
the
server
never
checked
on
us
at
all
a
party
of
6
you
would
think
she
been
motivated
She
came
up
took
appetizer
order
but
only
asked
few
us
Next
thing
new
was
gone
in
After
we
sat
dry
with
no
more
drinks
nor
did
check
again
frustrated
to
go
her
tell
need
our
checks
are
leaving
didn't
even
care
4
tables
including
Management
over
or
ask
why
cancelled
food
This
place
is
amateur
hour
If
they
want
survive
get
better
servers
management
needs
be
point
So
disappointed
there
Hopefully
it
fixed
Would
loved
actually
try

It
said
my

yet
at
7:30PM
that
I'd
get

Meanwhile
people
are
checking

I
ate

they
apologized

Huh

There's

overpriced
crap

There
was
note
saying
could
ask
housekeeping
for
fridge
Great
asked

FOR
A

declined
This
isn't

don't
know

I'll
come
back
Went
to
the

so
decided
order
it
Got
it
home
and
was
underwhelmed
Mushy
cold
tasteless
no

very
little

This
worst
food
experience
I've
ever
had
at
pei
wei
Gross
Meh
No
thanks
Waste
of
time
money
A
truly
disappointing
dinner
that
ended
in
trash
My
first
time
walking
in
here
I
could
not
find
an
available
representative
to
assist
me
They
are
extremely
busy
bunch
Thankfully
they
found
me
Haha
came
here
purchase
my
iMac

had
pleasant
experience
The
older
gentleman
who
helped
me
seemed
new
he
kept
apologizing
because
his
scanners
weren't
working
every
tried
scan
items
it
wasn't
working.(He
switch
scanner
3
times
a
rush
so
did
mind
at
all
Once
completed
another

get
things
going
Everything
was
convenient
easy
quick
Thanks
Apple
team
will
definitely
be
back
for
future
purchases
Nice
lunch
buffet
tasty
not
spicy
super
extensive
but
enough
to
be
full
for
sure
It
looks
like
a
dive
from
the
outside
try
it
Complimentary
Naan
which
was
REALLY
good
It's
VERY
dark
inside
no
natural
light
sort
of
bummer
lunch
Great
service
they
are
very
serious
tend
customers
well
BEDBUGS
Do
you
like
bloodsucking
parasites
No
Then
AVOID
ALL
THINGS
TRUMP
The
worst
thing
is
you'll
bring
em
home
with
you--YOU
CAN'T
ESCAPE
THEM.It
wasn't
my
choice
to
stay
in
a
Trump
hotel
but
few
stupid
people
made
the
decision
for
me
against
wishes
Now
we're
all
paying
it
What
nasty
place
What
happened
In
less
than
three
years
this
place
is
a
dump
The
floors
were
filthy
tables
trashy
food
was
cold
and
slip
on
the
plates
service
slow
staff
clueless
Yikes
Don't

Inattentive

Not

Seafood

Stumbled

It

Torn
about
my
recent
experience
here
I
haven't
been
in
years
but
heard
happy
hour
was
decent
so
gave
it
another
try
The
atmosphere
is
nice

upscale
casual
bar
area
Good
for
smaller
parties
of
4
or
under
Not
loud
good
to
actually
talk
and
catch
up
with
friends
Staff
attentive
did
a
last
call
hour
So
we
ordered
round
asked
them
wait
until
were
done
our
current
ones
When
one
that
thought
had
be
ordered
there
mix
up
They
quickly
grabbed
manager
rectified
the
situation
We
still
confused
how
they
charged
us
beverages
questioned
it
bartender
became
short
snippy
just
let
go
I'm
unsure
if
correctly
As
eats
decent
portions
food
Nothing
spectacular
adult
beverages
VERY
weak
Taste
good
not
much
alcohol
sure
I'll
return
Terrible
service
disappointing
experience
Took
my
daughters
there
on
Sunday
There
were
three
other
occupied
tables
in
the
entire
place
and
at
least
as
many
employees
customers
so
it's
not
like
they
super
busy
Ordered
drinks
that's
last
time
we
spoke
to
our
waitress
until
paid
tab
The
restaurant
was
virtually
empty
but
still
seated
a
group
of
people
directly
behind
us
instead
spacing
it
out
little
Waited
about
20
minutes
got
their
first
round
food
had
seen
place
an
order
Said
done
wanted
pay
tab
leave
hostess
unapologetic
frankly
couldn't
care
any
less
that
ignored
there
Used
be

really
spiraled
into
sad
with

Went
down

again
It's

fail
Now
I
know
why
empty
Great
place
to
eat
Eat
their
on
a
regular
basis
as
the
bowls
are
very
good
I
only
have
couple
of
minor
complaints
1
Chopsticks
cheap
and
often
break
Restaurant
should
spend
extra
few
penny's
for
good
chop
sticks
2
one
size
soft
drink
is
not
really
acceptable
these
days
Add
another
bolster
your
bottom
line
3
provide
adult
napkins
Those
napkins
classic
example
cutting
corners
I
have
been
to
a
lot
of
sushi
places
in
Arizona
and
this
place
is
by
far
the
best
one
The
staff
here
great
King
Kong
Rose
Sue
Josh
are
always
very
friendly
Tepanyaki
chefs
great
put
on
show
My
favorite
roll
Mexican
I
love
this
little
spot
Great
drinks
the
staff
is
awesome
and
ambiance
comfortable
chill
would
recommend
place
hands-down
as
one
of
my
fav
spots
in
area
can't
say
enough
about
staff
they
are
friendly
knowledgeable
fun
The
drink
list
extensive
have
a
great
selection
Scotch
if
that's
your
thing
I
think
that
AMC
stands
for
Al's
Movie
Center
Now
maybe
it
is
just
this
location
but
the
place
seemed
dirty
and
grungy
staff
wasn't
all
friendly
like
a
second
rate
movie
theater
instead
of
national
chain
Like
said
bad
am
biased
toward
other
large
local
Arizona

It
kind
funny

That's

I

my

today

more

you

Giving

everyone
just
have
this

stare
on

they
don't

HORRIBLE
but
the
bright
side
our

I
recently
had
my

cut

here
a
positive
experience

Christy
C
she
was
very
friendly
professional
She
fixed
up
blonde
highlights
on
roots
then
did
basic
trim
for
split
ends
listened
to
what
wanted
good
job
The
salon
itself
wasn't
particularly
impressive
or
unimpressive
It
fairly
typical
clean
reviews
Yelp
also
led
me
believe
that
this
would
be
an
inexpensive
place
get
done
but
it
over
100
This
is
am
used
spending
generally
at
places
seem
bit
fancier
Overall
experience
I'll
keep
looking
around
other
salons
in
the
area
Garbage

Way
overpriced
They

he

May
have
been

gave
it
an
extra

I
would
order

Every
I've
gone
in
even
simple
sandwich
myself
have
been
treated
great
customer
service
I
have
to
say
really
enjoyed
this
place
but
the
reason
why
didn't
give
it
5
Stars
waw
many
reasons
here
they
are
listed
below
1

The
steamed
white
rice
is
hard
find
it's
tucked
away
behind
desserts
close
restrooms
so
you
will
get
a
smell
of
bathrooms
before
eat

My
first
time

saw
another

So

Now

Always

If

Huge

great
job

Our
California
group
enjoyed
this
restaurant
so
much
we
went
to
their
sister
the
next
night
The
food
was
elegant
delicious
without
being
pretentious
Hearty
enough
for
of
farmers
at
our
table
Order
anything
you
won't
be
disappointed
but
sure
order
mashed
potatoes
Ah-ma-zing
Then
round
it
all
off
with
1/2
Arizona
Homemade
Smores
Trust
me
Laid
back
classy
loungy
club
with
cool
girls
You
can
chill
and
have
a
conversation
without
being
attacked
like
other
clubs
Always
great
time
all
if
the
craziness
We
have
had
Dr
Jackson
work
on
both
of
our
kids
smiles
He
has
reshaped
son's
jawline
incredibly
is
warm
and
easy
to
talk
to
are
fortunate
him
Our
mouth
was
more
complicated
than
most
His
pricing
policy
better
what
I
expecting
also
generous
in
supporting
the
local
school
communities
My
new
favourite
pizza
place
in
TO
Visited
the
Yonge
and
Dundas
store
which
I
think
is
their
first
location
Canada
Simply
awesome
pizzas
with
a
super
thin
crispy
crust
that
are
totally
delish
The
menu
has
variety
of
signature
pizzas
simple
cheese
sauce
pizza
or
you
can
build
your
own
We
built
our
own
all
toppings
It
was
bit
wet
near
middle
but
loved
it
ingredients
fresh
price
reasonable
They
also
have
an
app
for
ordering
track
purchases
rewards
ie
free
pizzas
Have
already
gone
back
several
times
Highly
recommend
I've
never
really
cared
for
bbq
or
smoked
foods
but
the
food
here
is
amazing
They
have
made
a
convert
out
of
me
It's
in
VEGAS
BABY
That's
all
Haha
just
playing
I
guess
you
can
say
this
place
is
like
a
modern
Havana
with
twist
For
those
who
cigars
for
you
This
located
inside
the
lovely
Mirage
Hotel
and
Casino
Once
walking
see
that
it's
all
white
atmosphere
pretty
groovy
The
bartender
was
super
nice
he
explained
whole
menu
to
me
great
grin
friendly
attitude
All
their
mixed
drinks
are
made
sugar
cane
or
agave
nectar
got
strawberry
margarita
it
amazing
My
sister
had
caipirinha
her
bf
mojito
It
bit
pricey
but
hey
When
Vegas
bound
spend
little
more
than
expected
So
go
ahead
enjoy
life
have
fun

Rhum
Bar
way
kick
off
night
The
best
pho
in
town
hands
down
only
bad
thing
I
can
say
is
that
they
are
closed
on
Mondays
If
you
forget
and
head
over
Monday
will
be
sad
to
have
settle
for
other
less
superior
pho
I
enjoy
a
great
little
corner
diner
It
seemed
like
place
that
everybody
knows
your
name

which
really
enjoyed
was
greeted
immediately
and
my
waitress
could
not
have
been
any
friendlier
The
some
what
full
for
mid
week
late
morning
but
coffee
cup
remained
full
Go
the
breakfast
omelets
are
heaping
ordered
everything
omelet
it
packed
Exactly
am
looking
when
order
something
this
This
first
visit
in
all
honesty
see
myself
coming
back
many
times
breakfast/lunch
find
It's
just
a
little
Crush
I
don't
understand
how
Crush
isn't
busier
Ok
can
undertand
wee
bit
being
that
it's
on
the
corner
of
12th
and
not
exactly
high
traffic
place
for
night
life
But
still
atmosphere
is
awesome-low
lighting
trendy
decor
have
yet
to
stop
in
full
meal
at
Crush
but
easily
my
go-to
drinks
when
think
17th
Ave
going
be
busy
On
last
visit
had
myself
peach
martini
It
was
juicy
sweet
They're
also
now
host
pool
table
still
looks
pretty
new
I've
got
crush
you

J-town
bakery
has
always
been
popular
especially
it's
located
very
close
to
me
whenever
I
crave
for
dessert
or
special
buns
my
first
to-go
choice
Not
only
it
creative
kawaii
fillings
are
quite
unique
as
well
Strawberry
cream
matcha
walnut-peach
jam
etc
The
reason
3-star
is
due
down
grade
of
the
bun
quality
I'd've
given
a
2-star
but
cakes
still
up
standard
so
fair
Nowadays
half
portion
what
used
be
cost
control
skins
thick
and
not
soft
I've
tried
few
times
hoping
that
just
occasional
outlier
apparently
norm
now
I'd
go
its
desserts
t&t
green
tea
pumpkin

Oreo
cookie
cream
panda
the
two
like
Hope
this
review
helps
Stayed
here
for
a
few
days
in
the
newly
remodeled
tower
I
really
enjoyed
my
stay
and
have
no
complaints
on
cleanliness
of
room
or
house
keeping
My
only
gripe
is
that
AC
so
freaking
loud
That
it
makes
hard
to
fall
asleep
3.5
stars
for
being
walking
distance
from
my
office
and
having
an
empty
spot
next
to
a
warm
sunny
window
The
food
is
by
no
means
gourmet
but
it's
filling
without
that
gut
rot
feeling
you
get
at
some
fast
Mexican
places
New
to
the
area
so
trying
different
breakfast
places
Got
a
coupon
for
this
restaurant
wanted
try
it
The
atmosphere
is
great

5
stars
watching
small
planes
and
helicopters
decor
too
with
model
hanging
everywhere
Unfortunately
food
average
at
best
service
was
slow
Portions
were
also
average
bacon
really
thin
not
crispy
very
tasty
only
2
pieces
too
I
had
ham
it
thick
cut
pretty
tasty
Read
about
potatoes
but
mine
under
cooked
just
ordinary
hash
browns
biscuit
ordered
dense
tasteless
orange
juice
seemed
watery
as
well
Conclusion
Too
many
other
places
won't
be
back
here
Not
going
to
sugar
coat
this
at
all
All
honesty
they
have
a
lot
of
room
improve
as
is
just
there
soft
opening
However
the
only
reason
why
I
would
rate
low
it
is
due
several
factors
that
really
need
on
Food
We
ordered
variety
things
on
menu
First
off
drunken
chicken
we
got
in
both
mild
and
spicy
version
Was
definitely
not
fan
version
nothing
stood
out
from
dish
do
however
thought
was
cooked
well
chicken
dry
Arancini
takoyaki
major
highlight
evening
enjoyed
every
aspect
particular
Using
risotto
something
didn't
expect
paid
well
Crab
cake
tostada
pretty
good
terms
flavoring
felt
dish
itself
overpriced
48
hour
Short
Rib
Donburi
good
wouldn't
pay
much
for
any
type
dishes
normally
but
say
had
no
grip
with
anything
The
short
rib
tender
jus
Kimchi
seafood
paella
most
underwelming
night
From
looks
expected
bit
spice
kick
dish
sadly
bland
undesirable
My
friend
also
found
mussel
smelled
rancid
kicked
side
moved
dessert
Finally
came
restaurant
first
place
Souffle
Pancake
As
one
few
people
experimenting
craze
see
what
hype
is
Definitely
below
expectations
ice
cream
comes
Service
Again
know
it's
opening
so
you
will
find
kinks
But
place
be
considered
upscale
better
service
then
this
A
cafe/restaurant
seats
about
30
In
capacity
your
servers
are
standing
around
unacceptable
bar
standards
should
set
higher
if
trying
quality
standard
moment
there
shouldn't
waiting
water
top
ups
checking
happens
end
finishing
when
can
clearly
around
Although
seem
friendly
enough
inexperience
I'm
writing
mainly
hoping
improve
Ambiance
Bit
too
bright
nice
decor
cafe
vibe
down
Overall
verdict
doing
well
food
decent
creativity
work
behind
BOH
team
Food
presented
excellently
while
some
hit
or
miss
think
them
What
suffers
ultimately
FOH
team
more
like
typical
run
mill
Go
For
Tea
upscale
dining
experience
opposed
recommending
them
other
people
let's
grow
This
is
the
only
Cane's
I've
been
to
Loved
it
from
start
We
live
right
down
road
so
it's
way
too
convenient
cuz
I
want
all
time
Lol
Best
chicken
fries
Texas
toast
and
Sauce
EVER
love
restaurant
inside
too
Super
busy
fast
Managers
were
nice
staff
was
on
it
I
used
to
like
Kitchen
Stuff
Plus
and
i
shop
here
a
lot
But
that
changed
now
because
of
what
they
did
me
I've
bought
cookie
press
i'm
not
happy
with
the
quality
so
decided
return
it
back
but
didn't
accept
said
its
used
Ofcourse
have
use
try
if
good
or
junk
It
makes
me
mad
was
supposed
buy
expensive
chopping
board
same
day
im
returning
change
my
mind
And
worse
part
is
edit
review
on
their
website
will
never
in
this
store
again
Their
policy
sucks
Sit
on
the
patio
while
it's
still
nice
outside
If
you're
in
mood
for
something
light
I
HIGHLY
recommend
oysters
The
cheese
board
is
worth
it
just
treatment
they
give
you

a
cheesemonger
comes
out
with
huge
selection
and
get
to
choose
from
cheeses
right
front
of
you
I've
also
been
one
time
brunch
cod
awesome
My
brother
loves
mussels
too

Snow
did
my
chrome
rose
gold
manicure
and
it
is
unreal
She
was
so
precise
that
nails
look
amazing
See
for
yourself
then
go
straight
to
Snow
This
seems
to
be
the
most
popular
brewery
in
Phoenix
area
Their
beer
is
everywhere
around
I
like
their
space
They
have
two
bars
that
could
see

one
as
you
first
enter
building
also
has
a
outside
window
serve
patio
guests
large
full
service
bar
dining
room
There
plenty
of
seating
We
sat
along
wall
with
plaques
displaying
various
awards
for
beer
several
different
styles
and
all
seemed
average
gravity
easy
drinking
can't
say
was
really
impressed
any
options
bit
weak
flavor
Food
wise
ordered
spicy
pork
dish
Carne
Adovado
or
something
that
beans
rice
quite
good
Service
good
but
nothing
exceptional
All
decent
place
very
locals
guess
just
my
more
creative
My
first
Cirque
experience
and
most
definitely
won't
be
the
last
Was
in
town
for
business
decided
to
go
show
being
a
huge
Beatles
fan
having
known
about
years
This
year
also
their
10th
anniversary
they've
announced
there's
added
new
features
Went
solo
instantly
made
friends
with
friendly
Beatles/Cirque
fans
who
had
been
multiple
shows
but
said
this
was
favorite
We
sat
balcony
an
amazing
view
of
show
The
sound
system
theatre
is
amazing
Of
course
no
phones
were
allowed
used
during
Everything
perfect
There
so
much
more
than
just
acrobatics
dancing
it
great
visuals
on
screens
curtains
really
effects
Also
shop
outside
tons
great
merch
prices
any
budget
Will
seeing
again
Awesome
food
I
love
the
atmosphere
Very
friendly
and
courteous
It
has
become
a
favorite
place
for
me
Great
price
and
wonderful
job
The
whole
team
is
fabulous
I'm
always
greeted
by
name
when
I
walk
in
the
door
with
great
enthusiasm
With
or
without
an
appointment
you
are
Served
quickly
Utopia
is
a
great
name
for
this
place
gem
nestled
cozily
in
Little
Italy
One
fact
that
they
offer
tons
of
lovely
vegetarian
options
which
means
you
can
bring
mixed
group
omnivores
and
veggie
people
still
keep
everyone
happy
Also
I
feel
like
overall
the
dining
experience
slightly
higher
priced
restaurant
always
nice
surprise
know
have
beautiful
varied
menu
with
lots
choices
but
am
cursed
being
so
love
one
particular
dish
at
moment
can't
manage
to
branch
out
something
different
Even
though
there
are
many
other
tempting
items
on
menu
Maybe
next
time
tend
go
afternoon
generally
brunchy
weekend
visit
I'll
usually
get
coffee
start
then
order
Chicken
Club
sounds
incredibly
boring
honestly
it's
delicious
It
comes
slim
tender
french
stick
baguette
chopped
into
three
decent
sized
portions
The
sandwich
topped
swiss
cheese
deliciously
seasoned
grilled
chicken
bacon
red
pepper
mayo
salad
greens
tomatoes
onions
And
side
some
Utopia's
golden
crispy
perfect
fries
will
side
green
onion
or
garlic
dill
mayo
fries
maybe
glass
white
wine
because
nothing
goes
better
fries
than
wine
lol
For
rest
only
plead
ignorance
say
my
friend
ALWAYS
gets
chicken
burrito
tried
it
that
yes
tasty
wow
does
taste
good
staff
also
great
casual
very
professional
good
checking
you
They're
happy
make
recommendations
too
In
summer
there's
really
back
patio
Overall
place
bit
too
tiny
that's
part
coziness
charm

except
when
wrong
time
wait
table
word
though
lovely
I
love
this
place
It
is
worth
the
drive
for
some
good
food
ordered
green
curry
and
it
was
awesome
but
wish
had
pumpkin
special
as
a
lady
next
to
me
did
she
said
die
for
I
have
owned
pets
my
whole
life
and
lived
in
several
locales
this
is
absolutely
the
best
vet
practice
I've
ever
had
good
fortune
to
find
patronize
So
many
reasons
1
They
are
open
7
days
a
week
never
wait
more
than
5
minutes
You
can
usually
get
same
day
appointment
2
also
emergency
hours
Last
month
was
frantic
because
at
10:00pm
dog
what
looked
like
an
infected
bug
bite
that
driving
her
insane
with
itching
called
24-hour
phone
number
immediately
put
touch
who
on
call
night
She
met
us
office
within
half
hour
3
Every
single
employed
there
I've
seen
them
all
knowledgeable
friendly
will
take
as
much
time
you
need
explain
every
last
detail
received
information
concern
from
any
human
doctor
including
mother's
oncologoist
always
blew

of
his

I
was
so
thrilled
to
find
this
place
tonight
have
a
few
days
off

and
randomly
wandering
the
Bell

corridor
in
search
of
something
interesting
at

What
found
Desert

My
experience
tonight
fantastic
The

genuinely

delicious
Your

though
You've

almost
3
months

I'm

Why

know
many
west

people
who
are
desperate
for
late

that

going

them
all

now
Also
get
you're
trying
emulate
business
model
Dutch

but
beg/plead/implore
consider
taking
things
different
more
unique
direction
If
want
they're

And
honestly

There

Yes...this

And
this
seriously
the

location
The
lobby
open
until
3am
on
weekends
Nothing
extraordinary
for
type
of
food
but
they
take
VERY
good
care
interior
Most
lights
are
off
so
it
looks
quite
dim
Coupled
with
soft
music
it's
like
scene
out
some
stoner
romance
film
employees
nice
and
lot
more
than
anyone
at

Indian
School
after

dropping
by
here
We
were
staying
near
the
airport
in
Charlotte
over
night
due
to
an
early
morning
flight
Caribbean
next
day
so
of
course
I
used
Yelp
find
this
delicious
unassuming
spot
It
was
a
Friday
and
worried
it
would
be
super
busy
but
our
surprise
only
about
halfway
filled
we
got
seated
immediately
Some
items
saw
photos
not
on
menu
like
bacon
wrapped
jalapeno
poppers
sigh
there
plenty
other
delicious
options
buffalo
chicken
sandwich
one
best
ones
had
ever
had
obviously
hand
breaded
cooked
perfection
They
make
their
own
dressings
blue

for

my
it
So
good
My
husband
burger
thought
perfectly
delicious
Very
decent
prices
full

Good
for

too
sad
live
2
hours
away
Love
love
the
new
remodel
After
my
terrific
massage
and
Reflexology
with
Anthony
it
is
so
nice
to
sit
relax
for
a
bit
longer
in
newly
remodeled
relaxation
area
I
would
just
like
to
say
the
Ahi
Tuna
Steak
had
was
as
good
it
gets
have
never
better
am
a
little
nervous
ordering
something
rare
even
though
my
steaks
medium
rare
afraid
tuna
might
be
too
close
raw
It
perfect
Not
and
not
over
cooked
Even
vegetables
that
were
served
outstanding
My
wife's
fish
chips
outstanding
also
They
very
light
right
about
of
breading
The
prices
are
bit
high
but
if
all
meals
this
good
is
worth
an
extra
dollar
or
two
We
came
here
on
a
Saturday
night
and
the
service
was
beyond
expectations
They
were
able
to
accommodate
party
of
10
without
any
issues
very
kind
considerate
ordered
20
piece
sashimi
with
side
sushi
rice
also
pop
rock
ocean
trout
which
true
its
name
With
sashimi
you
can
add
in
lobster
dish
for
an
additional
cost
will
need
go
back
their
happy
hour
menu
This
place
is
hot
and
cold
When
the
service
good
its
great
when
not
so
good
like
cool
oyster
stew
no
appeal
whatsoever
appointment
was
for
an
82500
mile
service
I'm
getting
ready
to
trade
my

but
wonderful
bingo
board
check
engine
light
on
yet
again
one
of
reasons
im
trading
it
I
instructed
them
do
Volvo
tell
me
what
came
four
yesterday
They
told
they
were
busy
received
a
call
4
hours
later
telling
it
then
asked
if
extended

covered
it
closed
So
nothing

you
are

see
can
pocket

Not

In
my
second
life
I
am
going
to
open
an
airport
restaurant
As
frequent
traveler
always
disappointed
with
Airport
food
offerings
hometown
Austin
is
among
the
worst
However
there
new
breed
of
restaurants
slowly
becoming
available
If
Beaudevin
was
located
outside
would
probably
give
it
three
star
rating
but
while
in
escape
from
surrounding
madness
Offering
wine
by
glass
at
great
value
small
plates
coffee
quiet
clean
and
friendly
environment
far
away
best
option
Charlotte
airport
After
surviving
TSA
another
delayed
flight
or
just
typical
maniacs
do
yourself
favor
grab
seat
at
Beaudevin
Been
to
this
place
a
couple
of
times
and
the
food
service
short
wait
times
ambience
cleanliness
is
outstanding
Unfortunately
several
family
members
both
were
constantly
moving
all
around
non-stop
from
couch
tables
kitchen
changing
television
shows
it
so
distracting
inappropriate
I
really
am
not
sure
if
will
go
back
They
act
like
house
that
they
live
there
business
w

For
God
sakes
make

scarce
I
eat
the
lemon

everytime
come
to

So
delish
Service
is
always
perfect
have
never
been
less
than
delighted

I
came
all
the
way
from
chandler
to
try
food
and
see
what
hype
is
about
had
a
wet
burrito
with
horchata
The
was
huge
meat
so
tender
They
many
healthy
choices
for
tortilla
it
tomatoes
basil
Horchata
homemade
get
second
large
drink
My
trip
worth
would
recommend
this
hidden
gem
I
ate
here
on
a
business
trip
and
the
food
was
delicious
ended
up
sitting
at
bar
for
dinner
Ryan
bartender/part
owner
very
friendly
highly
recommend
this
restaurant
Y'know
for
a
chain
Vocelli
puts
forth
perfectly
fine
pie
Someone
ordered
one
from
the
Carrick
location
during
our
monthly
Three
Rivers
Ferret
Council
meeting
and
I
was
rightly
impressed
with
its
puffy
crust
toasted
bottom
lusty
sauce
oily
pepperoni
cups
stringy
cheese
Having
not
had
pizza
reminded
of
why
they
populate
Western
Pennsylvania
as
prolifically
do
Even
their
Italian
hoagie
defeats
many
submarine
peddlers
baguette-like
bread
zesty
dressing
ample
meats
vegetables
Hey
if
left

Papa

The
cafe
is
a
little
tricky
to
find
even
though
you
can
see
it
from
the
freeway
but
just
drive
in
Durango
and
Sunset
you'll
business

eventually
It
was
surprisingly
busy
great
place
for
your

Fortunately
we
were
able
snag
table
as
well
I
ordered
with
very
friendly
Oliver
He
makes
feel
welcome
if
you're
his
home
After
had
placed
my
order
sat
down
he
brought

My
only
complaint
how
be
especially
difficult
get
seat
However
love
accessibility
tasty
French
café
eats
this
area
The
food
here
is
pretty
tasty
but
the
last
few
times
I
have
ordered
wings
and
fries
they
were
quite
crappy
due
to
oil
being
very
old
Please
change
out
your
when
it
gets
nasty
makes
tasty
junk
food
just
taste
like
junk
A
little
out
of
my
way
bit
a
very
nice
park
that
is
well
maintained
The
walking
trails
are
but
not
long
I
do
like
the
layout
and
how
accessible
different
services
are
Service
not
great
it
took
10
minutes
to
get
drinks
and
about
20
food
The
owner
who
appears
be
a
little
drunk
was
over
talkative
bit
strange
His
wife
sweetheart
I
wish
we
were
only
dealing
with
her
Food
side
dishes
poor
It
consisted
of
potatoes
reddish
yellow
radish
Monday
being
sprouts

all
which
somewhat
bland
in
overall
would
call
describe
as
Americanized
kimchi
actually
pretty
good
however
We
ordered
the
bib
pop
portion
medium
small
an
abundance
lettuce
also
contains
some
caviare
found
unusual
asked
guy
for
red

he
looked
at
me
like
space
creature
Yes
are
referring
that
appeared
drunk
squid
stirfry
surprisingly
very
well
done
highest
quality
seems
came
from

frozen

versus
someone
getting
preparing
inappropriately

If
this
restaurant
city
probably
keep
going
here
But
since
there
much
better
options
out
Takamatsu
that's
where
will
continue
go
now
on
is
dirty
has
strange
smell
I
like
the
food
and
overall
vibe
of
restaurant
However
this
was
a
problem
with
previous
owners
location
please
fix
ventilation/exhaust
fan
in
your
kitchen
You
are
immediately
blasted
by
smell
cooking
grease
when
you
walk
front
door
cannot
eat
here
leave
without
smelling
showered
deep
fryer
Now
that
have
out
way
can
really
tell
they
care
about
quality
here
looks
make
their
own
sausage
patties
use
some
ingredients
etc
Fix
air
issue
would
give
place
higher
rating
Decent
tasting
sub
But
this
location
is
maintained
poorly
It
not
only
dirty
but
has
a
horrible
smell
that
hits
you
immediately
after
opening
the
front
door
I
went
here
back
in
2006
so
have
no
idea
what
it's
like
now
That
being
said
remember
it
well
can
write
a
review
for
this
place
5
years
later
That's
gotta
mean
something
eh
never
knew
how
good
grits
could
be
until
tried
them
here
Wow
creamy
yet
light
and
oh
filling
had
the
lamb
quality
char
on
that
lamb
was
spectacular
I'm
not
fan
of
wedge
salads
but
they
make
damn
house
dressing
The
desserts
were
huge
fun
too
You
know
you
always
wish
there
more
caramelized
top
to
Crème
Brule
They
do
large
shallow
ramekin
there's
crack
enjoy
One
best
things
price
It's
extremely
reasonable
by
MN
standards
type
restaurant
at
time
MMmm
is
such
fantastic
memory
my
fist
visit
south
Mason-Dixon
It
is
a
little
more
on
the
expensive
side
for
size
you
are
getting
but
roll
was
best
one
I've
ever
had
so
it
definitely
worth
money
I
would
highly
recommend
trying
food
If
there
was
an
option
to
rate
it
with
no
stars
I
would
since
this
place
is
nothing
rave
about
The
lady
that
placing
our
order
the
glasses
and
short
black
hair
completely
rude
didn't
look
like
she
liked
her
job
Once
my
dad
received
food
dad's
salad
wrong
so
he
brought
back
up
counter
once
got
table
could
over
hear
say
something
about
oh
could've
just
picked
off
olives
burger
had
cold
not
tasty
a
better
at
Burger
King
right
next
door
Due
customer
service
crappy
food
quality
will
never
be
returning
here
again
This
review
is
based
on
my
mealpal
experience
today
With
mealpal
I
noticed
that
vendors
tend
to
pre-make
their
items
so
users
end
up
receiving
lunches
have
been
sitting
there
for
an
unidentified
amount
of
time
To
mitigate
this
always
pick
at
the
earliest
possible
time
slot
However
was
horrified
when
opened
takeout
box
from
this
restaurant
All
hype
had
heard
friends
and
all
high
reviews
were
debunked
My
burrito
dripping
with
moisture
hot
rice
water
content
vegetables
sauce
It
seriously
one
soggy
sushi
it
blatant
probably
counter
some
before
arrived
exactly
pick-ups
start
top
off
smallest
ever
tried
in
Toronto
only
two
or
three
dice
sized
slices
raw
fish
inside
didn't
seem
be
fresh
am
against
wasting
food
but
rare
moment
considered
throwing
entire
mess
away
after
several
bites
If
you
go
here
recommend
ordering
normally
regular
price
avoid
having
a
soggy
bland
meal
Tried
it
today
and
will
now
be
a
regular
Upon
entering
I
was
made
to
feel
at
home
very
comfortable
The
staff
were
professional
the
service
first
rate
ordered
pork
chorizo
burger
with

of

Tasting

5
of

but
should
be
The

with
Habernero
favorite
really
well
balanced
style
sauce
good
actually
very
just
a
tiny
bit
on
sweet
side
as
Bob
Garner
said
But
seriously
ask
for
tasting
you

it
they

steaming

Stars

brisket
You
must
request
marbled

anything

Next

would
be

Request
without

you
can

put

go

again
It's
great

and
also
fun
place
with
large

mashed

caramelized
bananas
the

is
Be

similar

any

should

your
entire

around
this
Enough
about
food
The
tacos
are
street-taco
style
little
smaller
great
sampling
lots
different
ones
usually
prefer
flour
tortillas
corn
tortillas
bad
With
that
being
said
I'm
going
guide
towards
tortilla
anyway
which
Crispy
Fish
taco
white
magic
sauce
I
it
sounds
fishy
PERFECT
Definitely
don't
leave
without

Standard

Funny
how
no

probably
delete
them
all
Being
a
lover
of
Indian
food
I
was
excited
that
my
group
chose
Situl
had
never
eaten
there
before
and
looking
forward
to
it
The
restaurant
few
customers
when
arrived
Appetizer
platters
already
been
ordered
term
platters
quite
an
exaggeration
would
have
used
the
salad
plates
But
appetizers
served
with
green
sauce
relish
listed
as
2
on
heat
scale
were
delicious
ordered
Vegetable
Karma
described
grated
vegetables
cheese

which
went

It
came
rice
also
garlic
naan
nice
but
meal
did
not
stand
out
visually
or
flavor
wise
adore
little
copper
pot
for
presentation
Now
one
think
if
expecting
10
12
be
adequate
staff

One
server
entire
place
Not
sure
how
many
chefs
kitchen
it
took
long
time
hour
greater
served
Other

seated
later
received
their
ate
left
we
did
guests
home
someone
who
didn't
plan
ahead
time
receive
our

small

probably

Great
to
eat
lunch
by
the
pool
The
Pizza
Marinara
was
probably
one
of
better
pizzas
I
have
ever
had
service
good
but
not
great
scenery
and
food
worth
it
though
If
you
are
staying
at
te
Venetian
or
Palazzo
definitely
give
a
try
Freed's
Bakery
did
a
fantastic
job
of
delivering
cannoli
cake
on
time
for
my
mother's
birthday
My
parents
were
staying
in
hotel
Vegas
the
week
and
I
wanted
to
surprise
mom
with
birthday
since
wouldn't
be
her
bakery
typically
likes
have
three
hour
window
span
deliver
their
goods
however
could
only
available
an
tops
accept
delivery
called
they
said
would
able
accommodate
crunch
Sure
enough
delivered
at
it
was
wonderful
mom
Not
mention
delicious
beautifully
decorated
very
pleased
service
say
least
I
used
Ken's
from
recommendation
of
a
valued
neighbor
They
came
few
days
after
called
were
on
time
and
very
friendly
efficient
asked
them
to
do
2
upholstered
chairs
at
the
last
minute
they
did
great
job
those
The
carpets
look
now
are
knowledgeable
about
what
made
etc
We
happy
with
results

Not
crunchy
stains
gone
such
nice
people
wore
booties
cover
their
shoes
raised
heavy
furniture
get
under
as
much
possible
So
have
company
would
trust
again
again
This
was
really
good
I
wasn't
expecting
much
but
the
dishes
were
unusual
and
nicely
executed
tasty
had
their
Enchiladas
Topicales
my
dining
companion
Relleno
Blanco
Both
good
eat
a
lot
of
Mexican
food
I'd
never
anything
quite
like
either
dish
they
both
delicious
will
absolutely
be
back
even
though
live
in
Chicago
only
visit
Champaign
occasionally

After

stopped
by
Menchie's

noticed

The

somewhat
disgusted
that

of

Save
yourself
lot
of
frustration

I
have
never
been
to
a
nail
salon
before
so
i
came
in
with
little
no
expectations
Ruth
did
my

and
she
was
very
friendly
patient
me
which
appreciated
lot
She
always
assured
let
her
know
if
felt
any
discomfort
asked
occasionally
satisfied
the

They

great
were

My

a
raspberry
frosted

I
feel

thought
hated
buttercream
had
to
be
soft
and
fluffy
good
world
has
been
turned
upside
down
by
this
deliciously
dense
perfectly
cake
Amazing
I'm
converted
Tried
this
ayce
by
looking
at
all
the
great
reviews
they
had
But
was
really
disappointed
The
sashimi
selection
very
limited
even
for
weekend
food
came
fast
but
price
not
worth
it
all
This
used
to
be
my
favorite
cafe
but
lately
it's
been
really
disappointing
The
last
4
times
I've
here
the
quality
of
drinks
have
especially
terrible
I
come
every
weekend
so
know
order
well
usually
get
a
small
hot
chai
and
it
was
chai
all
time
Since

always
around
11
PM

2
AM
on
Saturday
Friday
nights
thought
maybe
first
time
because
there
new
employee
CONSISTENTLY
like
this
ever
since
But
best
thing
about
place
lemon
lavender
cake
had
while
very
flavorful
moist
hope
hasn't
changed
Slowwwww
service
From
waiting
30
minutes
to
be
seated
with
open
tables
20
before
being
able
order
and
40
for
our
food
This
is
by
far
the
best
place
to
eat
in
Vegas
for
price
The
pizza
so
good
service
always
amazing
They
cater
large
parties
I
cant
say
enough
Every
time
we
go
this
a
must
have
My
entire
family
loves
and
everyone
have
recommended
here
Never
bad
time
THE
BEST
The
food
here
was
quite
nice
but
our
service
awful
Waitress
couldn't
be
bothered
with
us
Asked
what
gluten-free
on
the
menu
as
per
Yelp
tags
saying
it
catered
to
customers
snarled
and
said
in
response
it's
whatever
doesn't
have
gluten
so
just
read
it
Had
ask
another
waitress
who
bless
her
soul
helped
us
navigate
menu
Our
didn't
come
around
again
see
how
meal
going

had
go
up
for
a
further
side
which
would've
been
fine
if
weren't
attitude
At
end
of
meal
we
decided
happy
tipped
only
10
after
paid
she
returned
said
just
letting
you
know
you're
staying
Canada
while
tip
top
your
thanks
And
stormed
off
What
joke
ruined
decent
food
Food
was
very
good
Wife
loved
the
Pad
Thai
I
got
Siam
thai
dish
Very
well
seasoned
Service

Never
let
our
glasses
go
empty
Only
negative
is

from
door
5
Stars
for
carryout
or
summertime
I
don't
understand
why
this
place
has
you
waiting
in
line
for
an
hour
plus
when
no
one
is
inside
You're
losing
money
But
know
if
that's
worst
than
people
actually
waiting
Nope
I'm
good
luv
enjoy
Went
to
The
Ossington
instead
and
had
a
great
time
I
was
very
disappointed
with
this
restaurant
mostly
as
a
result
of
lousy
service
The
first
problem
is
they
apparently
reserve
each
table
for
the
full
night
So
despite
being
booked
8pm
refuse
to
allow
earlier
reservations
It
took
lot
convincing
get
6pm
reservation
promise
we
would
leave
by
8pm
sharp
next
don't
open
until
on
weeknights
When
arrived
at
5:50pm
there
another
couple
waiting
who
knocked
door
hostess
came
out
and
rudely
stated
didn't
six
she
not
let
us
in
from
cold
weather
because
were
having
staff
meeting
A
more
courteous
response
be
have
allowed
five
people
wait
inside
vestibule
6pm
Essentially
restaurant
has
all
pretentiousness
fine
French
without
that
quality
food
While
food
fairly
good
it
far
outstanding
amuse
bouches
got
mediocre
tuna
tartare
excellent
but
accompanying
crackers
too
salty
lobster
again
outstanding

bland
Overall
will
certainly
coming
back
service
or
least
these
bad
experiences
permanently
coloured
my
opinion
Ann
and
her
entire
team
have
been
nothing
short
of
wonderful
to
work
with
They
are
knowledgeable
prompt
with
responses
top
quality
for
any
our
needs
I
recommend
them
anyone
real
estate
assistance
This
is
the
place
to
get
some
food
while
you
are
drunk
or
about
head
bed
The
pizza
slice
can
feed
2
people
Comes
out
hot
I
believe
a

Say
no
more
fat
hangover
in

will
keep
full
Located

So
time
after

of
clubbing
ditch
mcdonalds
Pho
Hit
up
this
joint
Everything
tastes
good
when
you're
drunk
Ha
Always
good
and
consistent
Old
dining
place
food
rather
traditional
booths
Good
maybe
for
an
older
crowd
or
you
want
to
talk
intimately
with
friends
I
have
only
had
the
pulled
pork
Mac
n
cheese
and
a
soda
every
time
come
here
but
it's
so
good
don't
want
to
get
anything
else
The
is
just
spicy
enough
be
noticeable
pork
very
tender
sauce
not
overpowering
Kinda
steep
at
9
for
all
that
Outstanding
Myself
and
a
co
worker
tried
this
place
cute
little
on
whim
now
I
come
back
weekly
My
favorites
are
the
Turkey
Cranberry
croissant
The
Cuban
Both
sandwiches
with
their
own
house
made
sauce
which
is
what
really
makes
these
special
Order

Totally
worth
extra
50¢
only
wish
for
that
they
would
open

Ahwatukee
Yes

So

them
5
stars

refills
our
waitress
hardly
checked
us

any
problems
needed
addressing
I

April
2011
for
my
uncles

we
got
memorable
picture
taken
which
make
memories
last
forever
Came
in

and
a
budget
Dave
his

agreeable
price
Excellent

This
place
would

gotten
2

if
not
for
the
crappy
service
and
obnoxious
bus
boy
who
plowed
me
over
to
get
our

eye
my
talk

My

that
husband
friend

I

the
food
here

just
okay
At
first
our
waitress
great
then
after
we
ordered

down
hill
No

and
she
completely
forgot
about
order

When
asked
her

that

the
fact
that

My

is

just

about
because

after

are

claims
that

I'm

was

Used

tonight
and
ordered
a

cucumber

Their

has
wide
variety
of
Hawaiian
American

food
I
was
surprised
at
how
low
the
prices
were
The

delicious

all
tasted

they
threw
in
side
eel
sauce
for
me
without
even
requesting
it
also
Spicy
Tuna
roll
although
it
wasn't
spicy
enough
me
still
tasty
They
put
dressing
on

so
didn't
have
to
worry
about
cucs
being
soggy
Overall
pleased
I'll
try
out
restaurant
next
time
hear
amazing
desserts
Yeah

this
was
a
disappoint

We

our

so
we
opted
for

Thumbs
down
visit
You
honestly
can't
go
wrong
with
anything
here
Just
tried
the
pulled
rotisserie
chicken
sandwich
and
its
an
absolute
game
changer
I've
had
BBQ
plate
my
first
time
at
City
Smoke
of
course
Because
if
you
claim
to
be
a
restaurant
it
has
on
point
I
loved
Mac
n
Cheese
is
must
Rich
is
such
a
cool
guy
he
could
sell
just
about
anything
to
anyone
at
high
price
He
also
smart
so
I
think
that
what
might
be
doing
If
you
dont
care
getting
screwes
on
price
there
may
good
chance
happy
here
But
if
are
budget
arent
we
all
in
one
way
or
another
then
not
appreciate
their
you
have
come
before
tell
it
costs
game
and
even
when
they
still
would
cost
only
guys
charge
hourly
almost
as
much
lawyers
That
was
personally
looking
for
Finally
tried
me

of

I
was
really
surprised
This
used
to
be
the
cadillac
ranch
which
wasn't
a
fan
of
so
when
we
gave
it
try
today
weren't
expecting
much
We
went
after
work
had
few
drinks
an
appetizer
and
some
entrees
The

tots
I'm
always

We're
picky
eaters
are
getting
our

made

Sure
enough
my
wife's

came
out
with

being

no
cheese
this
isn't
problem
as

acknowledges

corrects
quickly
they
did
is
all
can
ask
for
Additionally
we're
cutting

of
fried
foods

bit
worried
got

but
actually

for
those
who
don't
want

heavier

We
have
stayed
at
the
Rio
many
times
and
over

ate
Buzios
times
use
to
talk
about
going
back
when
we
because
food
was
always
delicious
were
even
so
much
there
a

one
of

that
worked
would
make

Don't
go

laugh
at

They

Sure

I
have

with
my

and
the
food
is
delicious
The
menu
simple

They

their

very
friendly

I
have
been
a
nursing
student
at
SJHC
and
also
patient
would
like
to
comment
regarding
education
training
SJHC
was
in
the
Urban
Family
Health
Team
The
nurses
doctors
allied
health
teams
taught
me
compassion
understanding
leadership
care
When
first
came
them
bit
worried
accidentally
labelled
hospital
as
old
conservative
Christian
because
all
saw
very
Catholic
hospital
incorrect
on
my
assumptions
truly
apologise
What
learned
is
see
people
not
their
diagnosis
patients
who
did
any
money
some
proper
insurance
were
had
refugee
status
Team
what
they
needed
do
take
care
of
them
Before
anyone
gets
upset
about
insurance
for
care
advised
that
Church
helps
out
these
require
medical
attention
used
live
bubble
or
understand
living
poverty--I
will
admit
still
lot
learn
However
bursted
bubble
showed
how
many
our
incredibly
wealthy
nation
real
conditions
labels
diagnoses
people
patient
caring
during
stay
found
it
interesting
much
several
other
hospitals
GTA
but
efficiently
resources
hand
heard
discussing
facility
old
And
are
correct
look
effective
compassion
work
this
find
more
important
than
brand
new
fancy
beds
with
flat
screen
TVs
At
end
day
felt
really
good
patient
student
am
now
registered
nurse
another
Now

can

soft

incredible

Such
friendly

Clean

the

I've
wanted

Love
this
place
When
they
say

the
best

not
lying
Great
hole
in

feel
and
one
of
last
places
I
know
that
you
can
still
throw
your
peanuts
on
floor
that
being
said
this
place
is
uber
clean
Still
to
make
it
here
for
happy
hour
great
prices
It's
been
several
years
since
I've
here
and
I
see
the
name
has
changed
from
blue
sage
to
stone
grill
Along
with
that
change
came
a
breakfast
buffet
not
for
better
The
price
is
same
but
selection
dropped
dramatically
was
also
disappointed
service
place
empty
we
saw
our
server
twice
while
were
there
Doubt
will
go
back
again
shame
because
it
used
be
so
good
Terrible
experience
Percy
the
General
Manager
took
our
order
informed
us
of
a
long
wait
during
drive
through
order
We
said
ok
it
is
fine
Ordered
number
1
med
and
Number
11
but
to
just
get
four
because
would
take
while
both
with
lemonades
Got
window
waited
15
mins
complete
wrong
he
asked
what
drink
we
let
him
know
was
two
lemonades
then
proceeded
hand
one
new
dr.pepper
Tried
say
that
have
still
ended
up
in
failed
mission
My
friend
and
I
stumbled
upon
this
place
went
for
dinner
after
seeing
the
great
reviews
Plus
they
offer
free
salt
vinegar
fries
with
a
yelp
check-in
Yaaas
Salt
chips
are
my
favorite
may
make
mouth
feel
like
sand
paper
but
so
addicting
can't
get
enough
But
digress
The
night
we
came
here
it
was
busy
obviously
had
to
wait
We
couldn't
even
sit
at
bar
stand
awkwardly
in
way
drinks
were
tasty
There
lot
choose
from
combinations
cocktail
pretty
genius
Pricey
amount

heart
of
Kensington

It

Overall

At

service
alright
I
have
to
add
this
Today
started
off
as
a
disappointing
outing
B&N
We
ordered
our
lattes
and
they
were
burnt
My
husband
went
back
up
politely
explained
The
barista
asks
so
did
you
want
me
remake
them
I'm
thinking
oh
no
are
so
deliciously
burnt
we
just
thought
would
come
share
responds
yes
please
So
she
remakes
them
Lo
behold
yet
again
he
returns
says
sorry
but
these
also
well
remade
Ok
and
If
do
not
care
how
many
times
Burnt
is
my
requests
refund
wait
for
little
one
finish

Honest

And

along
with

B&N
being

Amazing
This
place
was
so
awesome
Now
I
know
why
there
a
line
out
of
the
door
didn't
mind
wait
but
if
you're
impatient
this
would
probably
not
be
best
for
you
But
have
to
say
it
worth
wait
ordered
Hurts
Dozen
which
is
dozen
where
staff
picks
It
12
more
than
Dunkin
Donuts
my
kids
loved
it
sooo
good
The
menu
self-explanatory
think
some
other
customers
really
understand
it
liked
guy
that
picked
donuts
he
had
sweet
little
accent
and
nice
He
tough
crowd
though
felt
bad
him
My
sister
lightened
up
mood
ended
having
good
time
when
we
were
there
nice
very
easy
find
service
fast
donuts
like
their
idea
setup
will
definitely
come
back
There
also
an
upstairs
go
don't
it's

how
looks
feel
too
adventurous
guess
that's
people
can
sit
down
enjoy
donuts
are
couple
seats
on
main
floor
as
well
Anyway
tastes
fresh
This
resort

Love

place
Where
to
begin
So
I
see
that
the
other
reviewers
on
here
are
liars
don't
know
what

is
because
this
place
is
lacking

The
madras
is
delicious
and
make
sure
to
get
the
garlic
naan
bread

I
don't
understand
how
anyone
can
like
the
food
at
Mandarin
It's
disgusting
not
even
real
Chinese
food
The
sushi
doesn't
have
raw
fish
in
it
it's
just
rice
and
cucumbers
This
this
place
is
closed
forever
f
my
life..I
love
place..I
was
really
hungry
and
I
went
there
around
12
midnight
seen
a
sign
that
said
places
for
lease
I'm
starving
at
time
wish
could
only
eat
one
more

I
went
here
on
a
Thursday
night
didn't
have
reservation
and
was
luckily
seated
with
my
date
We
ordered
gyoza
pork
dumplings
that
were
delicious
as
well
the
crunchy
roll
lobster
roll
both
of
which
highly
recommend
The
presentation
is
beautiful
small
bottle
wine
to
accompany
our
dinner
bill
came
about
100
very
it
This
best
sushi
ever
had
would
come
back
again
for
sure
This
is
a
good
place
to
start
the
week
for
Sunday
Rock
Garden
night
It's
basically
happy
hour
but
it
last
all
day

I
really
love
this
place
I've
become
HH
regular
here
can't
believe
didn't
go
here
sooner
in
my
whole
time
living
The
house
rolls
were
half
off
appetizers
and
drinks
off
as
well
My
favorites
here
For
signature
drink
there
did
fair
bit

Awesome
Thank

G
sincerely
Hawaii
residents
that

If
I
could
give
this
place
a
no
star
would
The
food
has
gotten
really,really
bad
ordered
delivery
3
times
and
all
of
those
not
only
did
they
take
forever
but
the
was
horrible
don't
know
if
change
cooks
or
what
will
never
order
from
them
again
Jeremy
was
great
He
very

showed
up
during
the

my

anyone

Good
gelato
at
a
high
price
Mercurio's
is
neat
little
place
located
in
the
heart
of
Shadyside
The
atmosphere
very
classy
and
feels
much
like
where
adults
would
enjoy
sweet
treat
selection
great
flavors
all
sound
delicious
I
was
confused
by
menu
behind
freezers
which
may
have
contributed
to
cost
my
gelato
Ultimately
ended
up
buying
medium-sized

range
weight
3oz
or
2.50
depending
on
how

This
will
be

The
food
was
alright
and
the
service
terrible
There
were
a
ton
of
waitresses
but
it
took
forever
to
even
be
able
place
our
order
Excellent

We
had

about
10pm
on

I
definitely

this
place
if
you
are
in
Vegas
looking
for
burger
Yum
The

the

I'll
be
back
I've
been
to
this
pizza
joint
a
few
times
now
of
their
locations
They
are
all
pretty
damn
good
Their
Pizza
is
one
the
best
pizzas
around
period
Salads
good
and
so
desert
have
some
coconut
cheesecake
that
amazing
The
ingredients
very
fresh
there's
plenty
toppings
on
pizza
crust
has
nice
texture
inside
crunchy
ends
only
downsides
it
gets
kind
busy
waiters
end
up
running
quite
bit
So
you're
attention
from
them
diminished
Also
also
pricey
Give
shot
they
make
great
pie
Such
good
service
The
cashier
is
so
knowledgeable
and
nice
I
love
this
place
already
the
cutest
ever
So
excited
to
try
boba
here
I'll
start
with
the
cons
front
doesnt
look
appealing
seemed
a
bit
cheap
but
that's
because
I'm
from
competitive
and
aggressive
sushi
area
During
service
few
missed
orders
it's
AYCE
so
forgiven
I
do
wish
there
was
hostess
wasn't
walking
in
awkwardly
asking
questions
for
seat
With
that
being
said
wouldn't
say
it
should
stray
you
away
trying
this
place
Here's
pros
great
food
options
an
AYCE
For
casual
eater
there's
probably

of
items
you've
never

The

I
had
just
landed
at
LAS
and
my
friends
picked
me
up
the
airport
My
first
stop
in
Vegas
was
KOMEX
It's
a
small
shopping
center
has
limited
parking
We
go
inside
there
are
about
8-10
tables
maybe
They
greet
us
as
we
enter
asked
if
we'd
like
to
dine
or
get
carry-out
they
let
choose
where
would
sit
sat
down
looked
over
menu
got
chips

dip
bulgogi
fries
taco
chicken
taco
kimchi
fried
rice
wth
egg
on
top
Everything
UHh-may-zing
tacos
came
corn

with
really
fresh
pico

type
of
toppings--diced
tomatoes
white
onions
cilantro
red

which
is

spicy-hot

expecting
Tobasco
but
out
chili

total
4

tried
every

awesome
bonus
The
Kimchi
spectacular
It
little
later
since
cook
everything
order
hot
spicy
good
slighly
crunchy
delicious
highly
recommend
this
dish
server
attentive
everyone
else
there
She
nice
checked
frequently
3pm
when
arrived
so
perhaps
all
THAT
busy
during
that
time
But
people
trickling
in
saw
other
ordered
burritos
from
afar
Next
time
visit
Las
Vegas
gotta
by
here
again
try
items
I
brought
a
large
group
here
for
friend's
bachelor
party
The
waitstaff
was
friendly
and
attentive
though
the
food
somewhat
slow
to
come
perhaps
due
size
of
group
steaks
were
all
perfectly
cooked
delicious
signature
complimentary
popovers
also
quite
tasty
We
received
an
amuse
bouche
chicken
liver
pate
crostini
which
not
in
line
with
my
personal
taste
nice
touch
Our
waiter
able
recommend
bottle
wine
which
reasonably
priced
My
one
complaint
deserts
each
lacked
flavor
creativity
All
would
definitely
this
restaurant
We
called
Vic
to
come
and
set
up
your
surround
sound
system
he
did
a
fabulous
job
even
connecting
an
ancient
VCR
the
system
were
very
impressed
would
definitely
call
him
again
for
any
other
Audio/video
we
might
require
Lehman's
deli
used
to
be
a
staple
for
my
co-workers
and
me
That
is
until
they
raised
their
prices
beyond
what
already
seemed
steep
Their
subs
dressed
with
lettuce
tomato
pickle
onion
are
tasty
but
will
leave
you
wanting
more
I
particularly
enjoyed
the
pastrami
turkey
sub
They
make
any
sub
your
liking
menu
large
have
variety
of
items
in
fridge
This
has
options
everyone
subs
sandwiches
appetizers
gyros
salads
fruit
etc
All
delectable
bit
overpriced
There
also
wide
selection
wine
beer
The
staff
very
friendly
accommodating
atmosphere
possesses
pastoral
feel
soft
spot
this
establishment
we
go
way
back
If
few
extra
bucks
pocket
lunch
give
it
try
You
won't

Caution
Caution
The
student
services
are
horable
I
took
a
course
got
high
grades
on
all
the
online
exams
but
when
it
came
to
final
was
disaster
It
had
be
done
in
paper
form
and
mailed
in
explanation
of
poorly
done
emailing
for
help
2
different
answers
same
question
chose
one
that
made
more
sense
my
exam
returned
me
as
incorrect
When
redid
using
other
explanation
well
not
sure
who
does
grading
they
obviously
don't
know
what
doing
thrid
time
thought
should
waitied
waited
sent
emails
told
never
received
back
so
get
certificate
have
certified
return
receipt
because
spent
money
course
did
work

been
lost
at
their
place
exam
WHAT
YEARS
am
still
trying
them
give
something
can
redo
grade
Ridiculous
They
shouldn't
even

like
every
throughout
course
Wish
would
YELP
first
Still
the
very
best
and
only
a
mile
from
old
location
Always
most
amazing
staff
high
quality
food
at
exactly
right
price
Every
time
we're
in

Absolutely

Mr
Mamas
I
used
to
come

back
before

a
Serial
Yelper
so
it
was
nice
return
which
did
for
lunch
today
accompanied
by
2
chefs
the
bar
set
pretty
high
and
they
were
both
game
when
Dish

wasn't
disappointed
Cajun

nasty

The

Great
job
DISH
locally
owned
places
like
this
am
they're
still
around
Avoid
this
location
Front
desk
staff
is
extremely
rude
Last
time
had
an
appointment
and
it
took
over
hour
after
the
to
get
called
back
Today
another
was
told
that
would
take
at
least
1
45
minutes
me
my
scheduled
appointment
This
no
way
run
a
business
Go
different
location
This
place
is
definitely
overpriced
for
what
it
is
I
knew
was
expensive
going
in
but
thought
the
food
would
be
much
better
am
cool
with
paying
100
plus
2
people
dinner
if
very
good
that
not
of
my
meal
at
Trader
Vic's
do
think
they
have
a
drink
menu
and
ambiance
different
It
does
feel
as
you
left
Scottsdale
when
are
this
restaurant
went
on
vacation
just
wish
better
price
place
What
a
cluster
Ignored
by
staff
when
I
walked
in
Had
to
ask
person
making
sandwiches
where
order
takeout
Person
taking
interrupted
the
conversation
twice
talk
with
other
staff
Has
me
repeatedly
what
had
just
said
her
Watched
one
sandwich
get
made
and
set
aside
5
minutes
later
second
was
not
made
Someone
finally
picked
up
first
went
looking
for
ticket
Finally
received
but
pastrami
ordered
cold
hot
Upon
pointing
that
out
told
they
didn't
serve
pastrami
Would
have
been
nice
know
ordered
lovely
cafe
Macarons
are
on
the
sweeter
side
with
probably
more
flour
than
almond
is
called
for
but
still
pretty
fluffy
Love
it
Like
many
of
the
reviewers
here
have
noted
I
had
pretty
high
expectations
before
we
ever
sat
down
at
our
table
on
Friday
night
heard
this
place
as
a
foodie-favorite
and
love
supporting
local
celeb-worthy
chef
After
great
cocktail
bar
LOVE
atmosphere
including
open
kitchen

very
warm
space
with
energy
enjoyed
mussel
app
The
size
appetizer
was
disarmingly
huge
When
server
brought
out
two
large
bowls
so
confused
that
asked
if
he
put
in
an
order
for
each
us
kindly
explained
it
just
one
split
us
WOW
did
not
finish
app
partially
because
huge
wasn't
life-altering
wanted
to
hold
better
flavors
come
ordered
fish
special
can't
remember
name
now
but
sea-bass
like
white
fish
my
date
peppersteak
We
some
splitting
switching
entrees
honestly...they
were
good
totally
solid
but
felt
bad
having
such
expectations
Solid
what
expecting...I
expecting
impressive
surprising
can't-get-enough
Overall
really
food
good
wouldn't
hesitate
go
business
dinner
or
accept
invitation
go
won't
be
picking
near
future
Because
much
hope
do
again
future
explore
menu
bit
more
perhaps
understand
hype
potential
seems
should
there
When
I
walked
in
thought
the
restaurant
was
decorated
very
nicely
There
were
quite
a
few
customers
for
Tuesday
morning
They
offer
loaves
of
bread
and
cinnamon
rolls
purchase
ordered
biscuits
cafe
omelet
almond
crusted
French
toast
with
hash
browns
The
browns
just
okay
but
really
good
have
good
variety
options
I'd
like
to
try
restaurant
again
waitress
nice
She
checked
on
me
often
helped
decide
what
order
only
unfortunate
part
didn't
receive
my
food
over
30
minutes
so
had
eat
quickly
ask
be
boxed
up
since
it
wasn't
ready
before
needed
leave
young
man
who
worked
register
also
apologized
wait

Very
friendly
and
attentive
service
Good
wings
although
I
would
like
to
see
more
variety
excellent
salad

We
will
def
be
back
We
used
the
roundtrip
limo
service
from
Presidential
on
our
trip
to
Vegas
this
weekend
for
8
students
and
I
have
say
it
was
fantastic

only
way
arrive
depart
with
that
many
people
truly
Adele
driver
both
times
she
great
Truly
made
us
feel
special
hilarious
The
ladies
loved
getting
roses
when
arrived
we
enjoyed
bottle
of
champagne
drink
in
She
also
took
liquor
store
Vdara
where
were
staying
a
wealth
information
what
see
go
Thanks
again
making
special
We'll
be
back
will
definitely
use
Limo
again
Me
and
my
wife
were
very
happy
They
timely
helped
us
out
of
a
horrible
situation
I
personally
would
recommend
to
anyone
My
myself
moves
all
the
small
annoying
things
This
really
speed
up
process
allowed
movers
focus
on
large
items
3.5
hours
entire
place
done
The
new
Barnes

Noble
just
opened
near
SouthPark
Mall...and
it's
about
time
For
being
an
upscale
mall
it
was
pretty
depressing
going
into
the
small
strip
mall
B&N
that
used
to
be
across
street
Of
course
now
you
have
wander
your
way
through
streets
behind
find
two-story
B&N
but
worth
it
This
has
everything
you've
come
expect
books
coffee
shop
and

my
favorite
Bargain
Bin
I
can't
remember
last
time
paid
full
price
for
a
book
huge
collection
of
bargain-priced
books
at
home
waiting
me
read
And
if
ever
quit
working
so
much
maybe
I'll
sit
down
enjoy
them
love
B&Ns
are
open
from
9-11
EVERY
day...even
on
Sundays
It's
sad
rarity
in
Charlotte
anything
do
or
anyplace
early
late
Sundays
welcome
change
this
bright
place
go
one
thing
I'm
can
no
longer

pop-out

Sigh
I
had
the
dry
aged
ribeye

With
out
a

best
steak
I've
in
Pittsburgh
Can't
beat
view
can't
service
and
food
Favorite
restaurant
Pittsburgh
After
2
days
of
finding
no
edible
food
here
it
Pittsburgh
FINALLY
stumbled
upon
this
place
The
crab
bisque
was
great
fresh
and
had
nice
chunks
meat
in
it
I
got
the
filet
mignon
for
my
entree
medium
rare
cooked
to
perfection
If
your
town
want
a
great
glass
wine
awesome
service
Sonoma
is
place

This
was
my
first
ever
Cirque
du
Soleil
show
I
impressed
with
what
witnessed
There's
not
much
more
to
add
based
on
the
hundreds
of
reviews
already
posted
To
those
who
have
gone
see
Mystere
would
describe
show
as...mysterious
you
should
known
say
that
a
lot
going
on
but
main
thing
is
that
performers
keep
crowd
engaged
from
beginning
end
Some
stunts
were
being
pulled
off
with
I'm
glad
got
tickets
for
online
weeks
ahead
Once
crew
Treasure
Island
Casino
lines
long
and
there
some
confusion
before
staff
started
letting
people
in
Nonetheless
pretty
everyone
in
left
satisfied
afterwards
My
plan
will
be
come
back
Vegas
order
experience
other
shows
particularly
O
Totem
KÀ
Michael
Jackson's
One
This
place
was
just
bad
Stayed
at
the
hotel
and
tried
using
their
20
off
coupon
featured
in
booklet
only
to
find
out
after
waiting
30
minutes
line
that
is
accepted
if
you
buy
whole
day
meal
deal
so
having
waited
long
I
bit
bullet
still
went
with
it
Big
mistake
on
my
part
Over
scrambled
eggs
rubbery
pancakes
dry
waffles
bland
sausages
Maybe
picked
wrong
things
but
seemed
all
over
poor
quality
for
a
that's
usually
hard
mess
up
Even
chocolate
milk
tasted
how
do
up
milk
would
recommend
looking
better
places
I
know
this
center
has
a
lot
of
uses
We
came
on
lazy
Sunday
morning
for
kids
play
time
8-12
am
This
is
truly
wonderful
place
both
and
adults
while
the
can
enjoy
variety
balls
toys
gymnastic
equipment
including
small
trampoline
adults
decent
cup
coffee

Nesspresso
3
espresso
3.5
latte
no
soy
milk
relax/chill
few
hours
There
are
only
2
things
will
fix
about
place
A
The
Why
it
open
until
12
during
weekend
B
price
6
per
person
including
kids
Usually
you
pay
or
not
which
makes
little
pricey
family
Overall
am
fan
Great
solution
those
cold
winter
days
I
don't
typically
review
grocery
stores
but
this
particular
location
won
we
over
when
found
their
bulk
section
had
been
looking
everywhere
including
other
Fry's
locations
for
pearl
barley
that
needed
a
recipe
couldn't
find
it
anywhere
so
gave
up
wandered
into
one
day
and
noticed
section
which
amazingly
barley
know
it's
kind
of
sad
something
small
gets
me
excited
but
what
can
say
I'm
easily
impressed
Besides
the
joys
are
store
has
nicer
atmosphere
than
I've
too
seems
to
have
slightly
larger
selection
as
well
This
definitely
become
my
new
main
store
Fine
tasting
pizzas
attentive
and
knowledgeable
staff
mixed
with
a
great
ambiance
Throw
in
incredibly
delicious
side
dishes
Brussel
sprouts

you
got
winner
My
teenage
son
got
his
nose
pierced
there

had
a
great
experience
Everyone
we
dealt
with
was
professional
friendly
WARNING
FOR
VEGETARIANS
This
is
one
of
those
places
that
it
really
difficult
to
order
vegetarian
and
when
you
get
your
food
are
still
not
too
sure
everything
meat
or
juice
free
so
kind
uncomfortable
We
all
veggies
have
experienced
we
ask
if
something
made
with
meat
they
say
I
don't
know
do
seem
care
find
out
Or
No
doubtful
them
check
come
back
confirm
were
right
Ugh
I
mind
a
veggie
menu
but
know
am
the
only
guy
asking
these
questions
The
was
OK
hard
evaluate
trying
figure
out
eating
broth
scared
will
make
sick
afternoon
Anyway
waiter
nice
helpful
It
hole
in
wall
as
others
described
There
better
Mexican
choices
nearby
for
carnivores
Check
my
reviews
more
on
that
UPDATE
I
WAS
a
regular
here
since
wrote
my
first
review
for
gel
manis
and
pedis
because
pleased
with
their
service
However
during
last
visit
on
8/20/16
will
not
be
coming
back
showed
up
around
11
am
wanting
to
just
get
mani
removed
which
got
done
there
2
weeks
prior
There
was
only
1
person
ahead
of
me
didn't
have
an
appointment
so
decided
wait
They
asked
if
wanted
anything
else
done
but
politely
declined
in
bit
hurry
guess
they
were
going
make
much
money
out
me
that
no
one
help
me
took
the
waiting
before
then
other
customers
came
AFTER
who
helped
right
away
kept
waiting
Then
finally
receptionist
it
okay
waited
another
30
minutes
available
technician
did
know
how
remove
nail
polish
replied
it's
okay
doesn't
how
polish
soak
nails
acetone
So
about
15
more
ignored
walked
there
ended
peeling
while
taking
shower
saved
few
bucks
And
back
again
Great
facility
efficient
service
very
reasonable
prices
Will

However
on

Costco
Sitting
at

None

that
they
melt
on
small
cast

Being

because

Other

These
nothing
remarkable
they

their
purposes
clothing
optional
spas
strip
However
first
where
actually
saw
people
take
advantage

So
be

and
that

The
day
before
planned

I
called
Spencers
confirming
the
delivery
they
took
final
payment
Then
two
hours
later
Justin
said

When

for
us
he
give
a

So

Sometimes
when
you
hear
the
word
Vintage
it
means
will
pay
higher
prices
so
true
if
you've
gone
to
The
Attic
It's
very
much
come
here
Since
I've
lived
here
this
location
has
changed
three
times
I
went
first
I
was
into
vintage
clothing
during
my
college
years
purchased
some
beautiful
dresses
went
a
BF's
prom
in
one
black
lace
on
top

dreamy
full
pleated
chiffon
skirt
from
1950s
gorgeous
and
luggage
still
have
it's
blue/green
plaid
hatbox
don't
remember
specifically
but
do
that
they
were
pretty
high
at
time
Great
place
money
buy
something
for
annual
Pimp
Ho
Ball
Thank
goodness
the
food
was
good
but
unfortunately
portions
were
small
and
we
left
hungry
We
told
wait
around
30
minutes
it
took
almost
an
hour
The
baffling
part
that
during
our
entire
there
always
consistently
at
least
5
open
tables
not
being
turned
quickly
all
making
for
such
a
poor
customer
experience
huge
waiting
room
of
people
crammed
together
to
wait
when
if
they
had
things
organized
wouldn't
have
empty
sitting
15
before
cleaned
seated
Once
got
seated
10
someone
come
greet
us
immediately
put
in
order
so
didn't
keep
waiting
Food
came
out
reasonable
amount
time
delicious
again
portions
Server
very
friendly
she
offered
us
cup
iced
tea
go
When
you're
done
eating
you
go
AGAIN
third
pay
your
check
Very
inefficient
management
going
on
here
due
lack
employees
They
everywhere
none
them
seemed
be
hurry
or
apologetic
about
any
waits
Not
sure
we'll
back
baesd
this
Went
yesterday
for
lunch
because
my
friend
needed
vegetarian
broth
They
had
quite
a
few
choices
Service
was
fantastic
and
food
came
out
in
timely
manner
I
would
definitely
recommend
Great
place
I
really
needed
my
dress
dry
cleaned
for
an
event
tomorrow
Two
previous
places
went
to
couldn't
have
ready
the
same
day
came
here
and
it
was
no
problem
Dropped
off
at
around
9:30AM
able
pick
up
3:00PM
hour
It
a
wonderful
experience
This
place
is
so
awesome
the
service
outstanding
and
food
delicious
fresh
my
favorite
orange
chicken
if
you
like
Pho
this
for
everyone
Very
nice
atmosphere
The
staff
wasn't
very
excited
She
looked
like
she
wanted
to
kill
me
We
got
a
smart
cookie
and
blended
green
tea
smoothie
Both
were
alright
smoothie
tasted
nothing
tea
It
poured
milk
added
scoop
of
sugar
Not
my
favorite
place
go
Went
Starbucks
right
after
Crown
Bakery
is
one
of
my
go-to
spots
to
satisfy
sweet
tooth
There
a
wide
variety
pastries
choose
from
cookies
buns
macarons
cakes
etc
Some
favorites
are
the
butter
bread
cream
cheese
bun
and
danishes
They
also
serve
drinks
I
really
like
hot
chocolate
latte
The
bakery
has
seating
perfect
for
hanging
out
talking
with
friends
or
studying
while
you
sip
on
your
latte
munch
some
dessert
decor
very
cute
vintage
like
It
makes
whole
place
feel
so
cozy
welcoming
customer
service
great
will
keep
being
repeat
sure
The
hot
and
mild
salsa
were
great
for
starters
Walked
in
was
greeted
right
away
shrimp
tacos
enchiladas
what
my
mom
I
ate
they
by
far
the
best
I've
had
awhile
My
dad

as
well
but
is
you
want
to

GREAT

Clean

be
back
often
One
of
the
best
if
not
dessert
experiences
I've
ever
had
A
must
your
a
tourist
or
local
The
experience
just
going
and
seeing
what
they
can
do
with
desserts
is
treat
on
its
own
But
actually
eat
make
absolutely
incredible
Every
bite
was
insanely
delicious
During
my
meal
with
son
at
the
Deer

location
of
Waffle

I
observed

I've
been
to
both
Monta
and
Sora
I
have
say
that
Sora
is
the
better
one
of
two
Sorry
Monta
but
you
don't
as
much
variety
space
compared
your
rival
The
corn
butter
ramen
with
miso
base
best
Adding
makes
broth
more
creamy
less
thin
it
tasted
like
heaven
was
skeptical
at
first
thought
they
were
crazy
for
adding
such
a
big
chunk
butter
wrong
Service
great
because
we
came
in
during
their
slow
hours
there
no
wait
Our
server
constantly
refilled
our
waters
checked
up
on
us
only
bad
thing
didn't
give
back
change
after
payed

Even
if
just

something

My
family

I
have
been
going

they

over
the
years
now

Ask

I
rolled
in
today
asking
for
an
oil

and
while
it
was
done
quickly
that
the
fact
one
older
worker

Mark
seemed
relatively
nice
are
about
only
things
can
rave
about
talked
to
a
man
who
some
sort
of
manager
based
on
his
name
tag
said
as
politely
possible
I
don't
want
this
come
off
rude
any
way
but
last
time
here
my
skid
plate
didn't
get
put
right
so
when
drove
away
few
minutes
later
popped
had
all
back
Is
there
we
make
sure
gets
right
he
says
No
no
no
that's
not
at
all
They
should
have
their
jobs
So
I'm
feeling
good
thinking

Well

The
best
Indian
food
we
frnds
had
in
3
years
Everything
was
very
delicious
Must
go
place
Since
the
last
review
was
three
years
ago
I
thought
would
try
and
update
this
It
doesn't
look
like
things
have
improved
any
though
recently
sold
our
first
house
felt
it
unnecessarily
complicated
time-consuming
definitely
agree
with
other
reviewer
that
they
are
slow
to
act
very
unwilling
provide
basic
services
such
as
emailing
forms
etc
however
even
worse
than
being
also
a
little
on
incompetent
side
After
finally
managed
get
them
send
me
preliminary
settlement
statement
found
major
errors
affected
final
amount
then
spent
next
two
weeks
going
back-and-forth
pointing
out
all
various
trying
corrected
The
kicker
days
before
closing
sent
statement
actually
full
of
errors
had
deal
someone
else
in
agency
corrected
so
we
could
moving
pulling
teeth
Or
maybe
having
teeth
pulled
don't
know
which
Basically
you
should
avoid
this
company
at
costs
If
see
name
appear
your
paperwork
contact
real
estate
agent
beg
change
title
companies
honestly
do
not
think
deserve
amount
charge
Move
over
barrios
This
place
is
ten
times
better
Came
here
twice
to
try
the
tacos
They're
as
good
authentic
tacos
in
cities
like
LA
or
San
Fran
Beautiful
presentation
too
Dark
cool
atmosphere
and
waiters
are
really
friendly
chill
Great
for
a
date
Prices
good
Taco

Check

Ample

This
store
is
CU's
foodie
mecca
and
for
good
reason
it
has
everything
Primarily
tailored
the
needs
of
international
students
former
city-dwellers
this
place
to
get
everything
from
ghee
chevre
Only
here
can
I
indulge
my
desire
German
Kinder
chocolate
Dutch
Roka
cheese
crispies
Middle
Eastern
Zaatar
Norwegian
lingonberries
They
also
have
a
selection
local
foods
nearby
farms
bakeries
Prices
are
far
more
reasonable
than
big
stores
like
Cost
Plus
World
Market
or
similar
Chicago
stores
For
gifts
gourmet
food
best
in
CU
I
want
to
go
here
every
single
day
Their
latté
art
is
adorable
the
coffee
exquisite
and
have
you
tried
their
sea
salt
caramel
brownie
Sooo
delicious
moist
The
atmosphere
lovely
for
a
catch-up
with
friends
or
reading/writing
highly
recommend
it
as
pleasant
break
from
mainstream
houses
Love
everything
about
Kekou
I
don't
normally
like
ice
cream
gasp
know
but
this
is
my
exception
Flavours
are
on
point
and
texture
perfect
The
location
great
as
well
there
other
fantastic
restaurants
boutiques
the
same
strip
store
itself
a
cute
little
house
with
good
amount
of
seating
out
front
Servers
always
friendly
fast
patient
They
encourage
customers
to
try
flavour
before
buying
Best
flavours
in
opinion
roasted
oolong
tea
hk
milk
whiskey
green
rum
condensed
milk
All
these
taste
real
thing
because
ingredients
used
for
cream
Overall
Kekou
does
simply
well
Definitely
one
summer
favourites
I
got
the
bulgogi
steak
taco
At
first
ordered
just
one
taco
to
try
it
received
two
tacos
for
2.50
and
they
were
really
good
Better
than
maize
sooo
much
better
chipotle
ended
up
leaving
with
3
more
orders
of
order
free
a
buy-one-get-one
deal
from
App
hooked
which
cashier
told
me
about
The
atmosphere
had
chill
vibe
Decoration
was
varied
big
mural
on
wall
shelf
neon
old
radios
etc
Would
recommend
quick
cheap
delicious
meal
Looking
forward
going
again
This
place
is
amazing
The
food
so
delicious
and
every
plate
made
fresh
I
have
not
found
another
Thai
that
can
compare
would
highly
recommend
this
over
again
Good
dogs
and
sausages
A
little
bit
on
the
salty
side
to
my
taste
but
its
good
food
overall
small
bite
it
seems
does
fill
you
up
if
order
fries
drink
make
a
combo
The
price
is
good
I
love
interior
of
restaurant
They
also
have
full
bar
do
delivery
Amazing
place
I
get

HomeTeam's

David
always

of
the

I
ordered
the

chicken
fettuccine
and
it
tasted
like

Obviously
was
cooked
on
same
grill
as
very
disappointed
This
my
second
visit
to
restaurant
will
be
last
I
don't
usually
rave
about
food
as
I'm
eating
dinner
Heck
stop
to
actually
taste
the
food
just
scarf
it
down
and
go
Tonight
was
an
exception
Starting
with
steamed
clams
for

The

just
okay
Well
I'm
not
happy
with
the
complete
and
total

from

The

I
recommend

Also
it

This
is
definitely
not

all

would
cost
me
hearts
desire
worth
at
any
chinatown
joint
I
give
this
4
stars
because
i
didn't
have
too
many
bad
things
say
about
food
but
price
think
much
even
comparing
AYCE
places
I
give
the
fantasy
girls
a
5
for
seductive
performance
Not
only
are
they
sexy
women
great
performers
to
top
it
off
The

beautiful

well
spent

pretty
funny
too
he
did
Michael

funny
Overall

I've

can't

I
didn't
get
too
fancy
2
carne
Asada

and
1
chicharron
taco
For
starters
the
were
good
Definitely
million
times
better
than
Robertos
Mexico
personally
found
taco
texture
was
on
point
Adding
crunch
to
it
great
new
for
whenever
cravings
Too
funny
it's
15
miles

highly
recommend
spot
The
worker
super
cool
too
Told
him
first
time
dude
show
me
what
up
how
order
Cool
had
a
bad
first
experience
but
after
sharing
my
experience
with
the
owner
he
replaced
plant
and
was
friendly
I
feel
that
he's
no
more
in
business
Dirty
Discarded

who
is
smoking

discarded
Gatorade

so
much

the
cans
they
are
overflowing
I
felt
perfectly
safe
here
but
feel
everywhere
If
have
any
option
am
not
going
to
use
this
station
because
of
all
debris
Went
in
early
March
for
a

I
used
to

moved
Charlotte
am
not
big
on
seafood
so
pork

which
is
great
and
macaroni

Will
definitely
be
regular
I
recently
made
my
way
here
for
a
happy
hour
and
was
pleasantly
surprised
The
new(er
hotel
on
the

hadn't
crossed
mind
to

tactful

my
1
choice
for

Their

place
generally
quiet
with

Food-wise
I
usually
go
either
steak
salad
fish
tacos
lobster
Cobb
salad
or
roll
portions
are
generous
find
it
a
good
value
your
money
Yes

set
you
at

per

but
getting
freshest
never
frozen
seafood

You
can
confidently
take
clients
here
assure
they
be
impressed
pleased
I
am
a
fan

I
ordered

Byblos
is
a
run-of-the-mill
Mediterranean

With

add
something

beyond
just
confusion
One
thing
worth
noting
they
own
waitstaff
clearly
don't

I've
come
to
believe
that
when
a
chef
skillfully
combines
his
talent
with
passion
truly
amazing
food
is
made
I
loved
my
evening
at
AMP

not
only
because
of
how
well
our
meal
was
executed
but
Chef

most
However
had
an

cousin's

and
needed
a
quick
clean
up
of

was
filled
with
anxiety
because
many
times
do
this

butchered

While

I
cannot
put

how
happy

My

scared
leaving

The

a

so
glad
we

This
is
the

beating

down
While
on

this
was
where
I
took
refuge
from

it

but
it's

There's

But
not

about

justifiably
I'll
pose

rhetorical
question
Why

earthy
snowy
scenes
drowned
with
primarily
whites
grays
light
earth
tones
I
was
in
town
for
CES
and
decided
to
try
this
place
This
is
a
small
hole-in-the-wall
joint
with
limited
seating
They
have
couple
of
big
screen
TVs
so
the
atmosphere
really
casual
You
walk
up
cashier
order
your
food
then
they
will
call
number
when
ready
went
standard
fish

chips
combo
get
pick
two
dipping
sauces
tried
curry
mango
European
mayo
to
dip
fries
as
do
Belgium
Netherlands
must
say
Gordon
Ramsay
did
great
job
The
light
flaky
not
dense
greasy
at
all
loved
sauce
Next
time
I'd
probably
just
sauce
both
my
choices
If
you're
looking
an
inexpensive
celebrity
chef
experience
Vegas
make
sure
you
check
out
Lately
the
quality
of
service
at
Panda
has
definitely
deminished
I've
have
been
a
customer
for
long
time
When
I
ask
my
plate
to
be
made
way
like
it
argued
with
by
employees
Most
meat
is
alot
vegetables
Therefore
when
they
serve
you
small
entree
that
give
seems
always
filled
more
vegetables
then
meat
request
them
try
not
me
so
much
I'm
told
will
smaller
portion
food
simply
don't
understand
why
would
rather
argue
your
satisfy
them
Obviously
this
company
become
big

After

almost
3
week
vacay
in

we
were
ready
for
American
comfort
food
What
mistake
to
eat
Bbq
at
an
airport
I
had
eaten
airport
Dallas
wasn't
disappointed
BUT
this
place
made
me
rethink
Bbq
ordered
the
meat
plate
with
ribs
sliced
brisket
potato
salad
as
side
My
husband
pulled
pork
sandwich
The
aftertaste
mbe
they
left
peppered
brine
or
something
bcuz
it
tasted
like
corned
beef
sauce
slathered
on
hot
give
you
counter
was
delicious
tried
mask
but
no
way
of
saving
ribs
hard
didn't
have
good
taste
other
than
their
generic
sauce
chilli
beans
overly
sweet
just
chunks
on
top
Mac
n
cheese
ok
best

eatable
not
very
tasty

place
Great

should
be
on
your
try
out
list
if
you're
coming
to

especially
close

For

that's

I've
been
seeing
Dr

for
now
have

The
pain
suffering
from

and
even
just
insisted

Very

They
find

Nice
little
place
to
get
a
cup
of
coffee
and
away
from
things
Staff
are
alway
nice
friendly
Overrated
simple
as
that
I
expected
more
and
during
this
visit
they
didn't
deliver
Atmosphere

A
negative
The
décor
is
very
nice
but
the
sound
volume
makes
an
enjoyable
place
for
a
couple
There
are
large
groups
bad
acoustics
pump
music
in
background
that
builds
it
up
noise
level
loud
Also
surprised
to
see
lady
walk
with
bulldog
on
leash
following
her
across
tile
she
sits
down
at
table
next
us
so
should
advertise
being
pet
friendly
Considering
sent
me

reminding
of
their

While
went

took

We

It
was
our
last
day
in
Toronto
and
we
were
the
mood
for
a
big
delicious
breakfast
That's
exactly
what
got
There
bit
of
line
up
but
being
it
Saturday
morning
to
be
expected
Once
sat
down
service
great
found
food
little
lack
luster
I
got
big
breakfast
as
you
can
expect
usual
suspects
eggs
bacon
beans
toast
hash
pancakes
decided
sub
out
toast
cheese
biscuit
which
best
part
meal
add
on
some
think
price
switch
3
expensive
worth
it
Overall
my
eggs
overdone
potato
lacked
personality
any
crispy
ends
usually
like
well
done
so
get
that
crunch
this
has
didn't
have
lot
flavor
better
than
anything
at
Denny's
or
Ihop
I
love
this
pizza
Sometimes
the
sauce
is
a
little
sweet
but
other
than
that
delicious
pizza
don't
have
much
interaction
with
staff
so
my
review
purely
food
related

We
are
renting
through
renters
warehouse
and
have
had
a
few
issues
way
too
many
for
only
being
here
4
months
but
the
owners
been
difficult
With
our
last
issue
we've
dealing
with
Jeff
Jarhman
he
has
on
top
of
it
very
helpful
middleman
between
us
as
owners
My
husband
I
haven't
greatest
experience
either
best
part
Renters
hope
that
from
out
to
deal
Jeff
He's
polite
because
him
may
redeemed
themselves
Really
enjoyed
the
pizza
and
being
able
to
get
whatever
I
wanted
on
it
It's
a
good
bit
of
pizza
for
only
8
also
liked
their
beverage
selection
The
blood
orange
lemonade
is
bomb
We
went
Sunday
afternoon
line
was
really
long
moving
slow
As
in
took
27
minutes
from
start
finish
So
not
quick
experience
we
anticipated
know
now
that
would
wait
again
but
definitely
be
back
another
pizza

I
wish

give
10

This
is
a
great
casual
location
to
enjoy

The

Prior

at

I
ducked
into
this

of

some
time
found
that
it
mostly
measured
up
what
had
heard

A
number
years

a
close
relative
gifted
me
CD's
vinyl
for
Christmas
they
acquired
them
from
storehouse
sonic
pleasure
known
as
Attic
Record
Store
Upon
skulking
about
the
place
my
only
complaint
The
is
felt
their
prices
were
touch
out
line
saw
used
not
imports
or
out-of-print
being
sold
17
up
almost
bought
Ian

Attic's

Some

Therein
lies

however
With

any
longer

the
first
time
yesterday
7/13/17
around
4PM
prior
to
dinner
rush
The
restaurant
is
clean
with
a
modern/minimalist
interior
frequent
Greek/Mediterranian

quite
often

You

They

As
someone
who
restricted

I
appreciate
that
can
get

separately

without
hassle
weird

He
substituted

It

been

I've
seen

don't
like

but
they

it
We
adopted

2
years
ago
from

The
staff
here

tried
looking
at
other

in
the
area
none
even
come

AAWL's

As
a

which
they
delivered

When
arrived
I
looked
at
the
card
first
and
it
was
sweetest
ever
With
joy
feeling
happiness

My
feelings
changed
instantly
from

After

sad
thanked
for

text
then
had
confess
him
that
call
complain

his
fault
but
he
apologizes
anyways
It

gesture
part

Few
hours
later

What
sad
day
celebrate
an

I
came
here
with
my
sisters
for
brunch
on
a
Sunday
so
there
was
free
street
parking
Yay
The
decor
is
nice
and
the
tables
are
well
spaced
out
We
were
seated
by
bar
area
close
to
entrance
They
have
huge
windows

there
was

ended
with
picking
month
later
wires

I've
used

I'll
probably
bring

years
when

Its

I
ordered
a

today
for
my

in

minutes
Only

Let
me
start
off
by
saying
I
LOVE
this
bar
live
around
the
plateau
and
has
been
my
go-to
place
with
friends
for
past
couple
of
years
This
is
what
a
BAR
is
great
get
togethers
friends
have
drinks
etc
The
biggest
issue
RUDE

they
don't
even
try
to
hide
it

Ive
ever
had
Off
hook
good
will
become
regular
here
like
am
at
Portellos
Chicago
Service
was
great
this
Clean
clean
clean
It
truly
worth
stopping
in
you
wont
be
disappointed
Wow
what
a
waste
of
70
On
two
apps
pasta
one
drink
and
bad
service
I
felt
guilty
for
dragging
out-of-town
friends
here
The
apps
cheesesteak
dumplings
lamb
chops
were
actually
pretty
good
Except
that
the
trying
to
be
super
fancy
small
expensive
when
First
is
just
not
kind
place
got
Cotton
Candy
Kiss
which
was
tasty
but
did
come
with
extra
kiss
in
shaker
as
others
have
experienced
mushroom
pappardelle
absolute
worst
It
bland
yet
swimming
pool
butter/oil/whatnot
Pretty
disgusting
Oh
pretzels
they
serve
you
Warm
hard
warm
like
had
been
sitting
out
too
long
stuck
microwave
And
mustard
dipping
sauces
unappetizing
so
excited
cos
love
my
mustard

Service
also
sucked
Our
waiter
potential
douchebag
we
flag
someone
else
down
needed
something
never
doing
They
need
update
their
online
menu
prices
definitely
increased
charged
different
than
listed
on
menu
random...a
few
cents
more
here
less
there
So
it
didn't
really
matter
end
Just
another
annoying
thing
noticed
atmosphere
seemed
cool
But
some
reason
surrounded
by
older
folks
who
probably
money
spending
wasn't
feeling
it
FAKE
What
a
treasure
to
have
in
this
town
Plenty
of
hands-on
exhibits
for
kids
all
ages
There
are
even
live
demonstrations
involving
flour
sifters
and
blowtorches
I
defy
any
kid
be
bored
when
blowtorches
on-hand
The
entrance
fee
seems
bit
pricey
but
it's
an
honest
2
hours
entertainment
at
least
They
validate
parking
which
is
free
the
first
hour
This
place
was
fun
but
not
worth
a
Mich
Star
My
tomato
course
had
unripe
tomatoes
I
have
literally
never
gambled
anywhere
before
coming
here
but
know
what
like
and
I've
got
mixed
feelings
about
this
establishment
Yes
understand
the
city
of
Glendale
is
a
party
pooper
who
would
rather
not
allow
place
to
exist
as
result
it's
been
hit
hard
by
fun
police
No
booze
yet...but
stone's
throw
from
two
large
plazas
that
an
abundance
it
Security
lazy
AF
I'm
sure
no
one
care
stop
you
bringing
flask
It's
essentially
giant
room
filled
with
slot
machines
extremely
questionable
characters
unavoidable
secondhand
indoor
smoking
But
no-pressure
environment
Where
can
get
in
out
whenever
feel
like
Free
valet
park
yourself
entry
fee
don't
go
outskirts
town
appreciate
these
little
things
While
though
great
for
entry-level
individuals
myself
really
too
bare-bones
plan
your
night
around
This
will
be
much
more
than
quick
excursion
I'll
back
spend
hour
front
haze
flashing
lights
Snooze
went
beyond
my
expectations
Pleasantly
greeted
upon
entry
Sat
in
a
good
location
Greeted
by
server
almost
immediately
The
food
blew
mind
Everything
was
cooked
perfectly
bacon
thick
cut
and
exactly
to
liking
atmosphere
set
great
mood
everyone
polite
I
would
recommend
this
amazing
joint
anyone
who
enjoys
their
breakfast
don't
know
if
i
will
eat
breakfast
at
any
other
place
again
feel
spoiled
Lol
James

He
very

I
would

We

the
80s
Marcie
Garcia
How
has
this
place
not
garnered
much
attention
I'm
thinking
the
location
may
be
a
culprit
This
is
an
old-town-esque
restaurant
that
ended
up
on
other
side
of
tracks
I
met
friend
for
Sunday
brunch
and
was
surprised
to
arrive
in
empty
restaurant
I'll
begin
by
complimenting
jovial
attentive
staff
They
could
have
been
any
friendlier
or
competent
Our
server
always
seemed
earshot
away
anything
but
quaint
Maybe
it
would
different
had
dining
room
more
crowded
ordered
frittata
which
prepared
with
farm-fresh
vegetables
served
perfectly-roasted
spiced
potatoes
My
cobb
salad
looked
amazing
he
impressed
spices
they
added
some
ingredients
also
coffee
served
obviously
freshly-ground
just
brewed
The
atmosphere
ultra-modern
pass
West
Elm
showroom
though
high-end
5
stars
my
at
Avalon
Frapp
machine
always
broken
Food
just
isn't
as
good
anymore
Hard
buns..old
chicken

Fries
are
though
Over
the
last
two
years
this
place
has
charged
my
mother
close
to
3,500
for
car
repairs
Shocks
struts
front
and
rear
breaks
break
fluid
whatever
that
is
several
receipts
just
said
repairs
Every
time
she
goes
fir
an
oil
change
they
find
a
problem
that's
at
least
250
repair
I've
repeatedly
told
her
not
go
here
anymore
but
insists
guys
are
nice
brought
it
in
few
weeks
ago
because
was
squeaking

She

fix
whatever
was
I
used
yesterday
only
fixed
didn't
even
have
courtesy
windshield
wipers
which
were
strips
or
add
wiper
fluid
The
best
part
is
less
than
26,000
miles
on
it
Why
like
need
new

struts

Doesn't
know
what
pothole

22,000
can't
figure
out
This
guy
knows
siblings
live
out
of
elderly
lives
alone
Shame
you
taking
advantage
woman
This
place
has
some
if
the
best
Italian
food
I've
ever
had
Our
waitress
was
terrific
drinks
were
delicious
phenomenal
and
view
isn't
so
bad
either
The
corn
pancakes
are
the
stars
of
this
restaurant
It
sets
your
palate
up
for
greasy
salty
fried
chicken
Arnold
Palmer
is
a
must
to
wash
down
some
grease
lingering
in
esophagus
Food
comes
at
Southern
pace
too
It's
OK
though
just
eat
more
pancakes
Service
excellent
and
owner
swings
by
every
so
often
hospitality
Reminds
me
my
childhood
Mississippi
I
have
sing
song
time
I
spell
state
New
pho
place
close
to
my
place
Awesome
Their
is
good
but
the
guy
who
took
our
order
gets
confused
He
switched
daughter's
and
order
also
forgot
give
us
plate
of
bean
sprouts
basil
lime
We
ordered
pastry
puff
as
well
he
didn't
tell
until
we
inquired
about
this
later

that
they
were
out
it
The
food
very
though
Service
fast
Place
clean
You
could
customize
your
with
own
choice
meats
They
have
Vietnamese
coffee
served
French
press

a
must
try
Worth
going
back
to
I
came
here
on
Saturday
for
lunch
with
my
husband
and
sat
at
the
bar
Our
bartender
was
Sin
she
recommended
a
blackberry
Margarita
sugar
rim
Great
choice
sweet
tooth
had
carne
asada
burrito
Siegel
plate
Everything
so
fresh
delicious
The
service
exceptional
we
will
definitely
be
coming
back
to
try
some
other
dishes
out
Decent
but
overpriced
I
didn't
feel
there
was
anything
special
about
Demore's
It's
not
bad
it's
good
enough
for
me
to
go
back
My
friend
and
walked
in
place
a
takeout
order
at
5:00
pm
on
Tuesday
We
ordered
large
12
cut
plain
cheese
pizza
10.99
an
Italian
calzone
10.25

1.50
because
he
added
2
toppings
which
are
0.75
piece
of
breadsticks
6.99
The
gentleman
behind
the
counter
told
us
it
would
take
15
minutes
sat
25
minutes
I
made
sure
look
clock
my
phone
personally
mind
that
our
took
10
longer
than
we
were
would
purposes
reviewing
place

night
people
working

neither
one
them
seemed
be

So

Hey
first
I
don't
like
to
spend
my
hard
earned
ka-ching
with
the
evil
empire
have
been
coming
this
local
coffee
shop
since
opened
their
doors
My
morning
drink
is
Cappuccino
skinny
They
make
it
right
every
time
If
wanted
a
latte
would
ordered
one
The
baristas

always
are
willing

you
up
use
good

materials

show
it
was
told
they
aren't
pulling
Illy
shots
anymore
as
got
into
pricing
squabble
them
but
still
there
Very
overrated
Rude
and
very
full
of
themselves
Have
been
many
times
before
but
are
not
worth
the
money
Many
better
places
in
Scottsdale
to
get
good
mexican
food
Don't
waste
your
time
or
money
on
their
schedule
I
saw
the
review
in
Scene
magazine
so
figured
would
check
it
out
The
wait
time
is
definitely
a
problem
waited
good
20
minutes
for
my
food
and
lady
front
of
me
gave
up
on
waiting
her
naan
This
seems
like
something
they
could
easily
fix
with
worked
people
that
actually
work
restaurants
chairs
couch
to
are
not
comfy
TV
was
broken
Ended
walking
around
grocery

next
then
playing

As

We
have

Great

diner
The
people
are

quick

large

A

is
what
you
need
Shay's
has
it
I've
now
had
two
dogs
attacked
and
almost
killed
here
Not
good
for
submissive
dogs
The
rules
are
not
enforced
well
In
addition
to
specializing
in
acoustic
guitars
Spruce

also
covers
instruments
that
have
been
largely
neglected
by
guitar
stores
and
band/orchestra
retailers
mandolins
ukuleles
banjos
dulcimers
lap
steels
harps
They've
got
a
bunch
of
violins
violas
sense
it's
difficult
compare
them
other
because
nobody
else
even
has
this
stuff
I
was
just
elated
more
than
one
or
two
choices
for
these
instruments
had
80-year-old
ukulele
needed
some
work
make
it
playable
again
felt
really
involved
the
repair
process
They
informed
me
different
options

helped
were
within
my
budget
The

plays
great
now
comfortable

hear
is

can
be

elitist
While
never
any

there
truth
statement
Stopped
in
here
one
night
to
have
a
bite
and
try
some
beers
Because
there
were
only
two
of
us
we
sat
uber
small
booth
away
from
the
rest
restaurant
tables
beside
bar
Seating
was
bit
annoying
but
whatever
We
ordered
shrimp
po
boy
angry
hawaiian

Pizza

Loved

The
po-boy
really

Update
went

Would
like
bring

finally
get

If
you
choose
the

I've
been
nothing
but
happy
with

and
I
honestly
feel
welcome
well
taken
care
of
every
time
call
see
doctor
The
venue
is
nice
and
the
food
good
but
service
way
under
par
I've
been
twice
it's
consistently
poor
You
have
to
hunt
server
down
initially
they
don't
clear
used
glasses
dishes
There
are
better
options
for
full
theaters
in
Valley
My
situation
is
Identical
to
Michelle
M
I
also
got
the
pillows
from
Teambuy
and
they
did
not
ship
instead
of
calling
however
took
internet
found
that
people
were
having
problems
with
Nasafoam
a
Kijiji
deal
figured
had
been
scammed
would
never
see
pillow
A
few
days
later
received
an
email
saying
manufacturing
error
be
shipping
out
soon
small
glimmer
hope
returned
until
yesterday
when
pillows
The
box
was
so
wasn't
sure
how
two
fit
opened
it
there
incredible
rolled
up
unwrapped
them
lay
get
back
normal

or
thought
but
turned
tiny

regular
looking

no
memory
it
really
find
hard
believe
this
made

worth
over

even
letting

don't
expect

either
WASTE
OF
TIME
AND
MONEY
If
happened
you
write
review
we
can
prevent
happening
others
Saw
a
friend
in
the
courtyard
and
he
invited
me
to
lunch
what
called
very
nice
quite
place
with
great
variety
of
unique
food
deserts
We
arrived
it
was
comfortable
environment
for
social
time
get
caught
up
The
menu
had
lots
choices
but
we
settled
on
Chicken
Wrap
However
I
opted
clam
chowder
as
our
server
Quinn
hope
got
that
right
suggested
because
would
be
like
nothing
have
tasted
before
she
right
It
absolutely
YUMMY
say
best
ever
tasted
cross
between
vegetable
soup
type
broth
perfectly
cooked
seafood
Make
sure
ask
your
server
really
made
us
feel
special
She
gave
talk
always
stop
by
keep
water
glasses
full
Chick
wrap
good
Clam
Chowder
earns
you
guys
home
run
look
forward
my
next
visit
If
you
have
a
hungry
crowd
then
this
your
Italian
joint
Caution
its
family
style
large
portions
is
an
understatement
Dale
Ann
Dorsey
is
the
best
I
have
found
She
never
drops
ball
quick
to
help

someone
you
can
count
on
amazing
and
don't
know
what
My
Family
would
do
without
her
Even
when
pester
her
she
always
in
good
spirits
Thank
you

I
was
hungry
and
it's
late
wanted
a
hamburger
thought
I've
never
actually
had
an
in-N-out
Burger
so
let's
try
one
Well
it
wasn't
fast
my
order
taken
at
9:20
9:34
number
called
the
subsequent
5
orders
all
came
out
over
next
five
minutes...hmmm
Since
burger
from
here
My
impression
they
served
best
burgers
around
well
lot
type
extra
time
for
great
burger...right
Nope
patty
thinner
than
Micky
D's
on
top
of
that
is
pink
in
middle
didn't
think
possible
to
cook
thin
still
have
put
k
middle
Normally
do
t
eat
especially
ones
food
restaurants
with
them
but
tonight
too
damn
care
Not
impressed
service
or
burger
The
fries
were
stellar
That's
how
you
get
three
star
effort
weak
sauce
performance
They
never
showed
up
for
cleaning
despite
makindg
the
appointment
days
before
No
calls
to
explain
or
apologize
I
am
writing
this
update
because
have
been
going
to
Diamond
for
awhile
now
can
honestly
say
is
one
of
the
first
shops
that
where
owners
really
care
about
making
customers
happy
Thuy
and
Sam
are
great
love
my
nail

I
like
this
mall
its
pretty
big
and
enjoy
visiting
mall
whenever
go
to
Vegas
What
a
great
place
Organic
fairly
healthy
lots
of
good
tasty
options
including
rice
and
tapioca
pizza
dough
that
was
just
outstanding
The
salads
are
outstanding
fresh
cleverly
put
together
service
is
also
quite
good
Try
the
pasta
dishes
too
as
both
chicken
piccata
lasagna
were
Fantastic
If
you
think
Ragu
is
good
spaghetti
sauce
and
want
to
pay
top
dollar
for
it
this
might
be
the
place
you
The
eggplant
rollatini
was
awful
tasteless
I'm
not
sure
how
made
ricotta
filling
tastlest
as
well
but
it's
actually
impressive
because
they
pulled
off
I
scooped
out
taste
tasted
like
baked
cottage
cheese
side
exposed
flavorless
that
obviously
came
from
a
can
Ceasar
salad
butterfinger
cheese
cake
decent
would
never
go
back
recommend
anyone
has
ever
had
Italian
food
avoid
place
Gem
of
a
restaurant
Probably
the
best
indian
food
in
Toronto
Each
time
we
go
thoroughly
enjoy
and
Suresh
is
such
warm
welcoming
host
We
will
keep
going
back
there
again
If
you
haven't
been
here...go
now
Hands
down
the
best
pedicure
I

ever
had
They
did
an
amazing
job
on
both
my
gel
manicure
and
pedicure
took
their
time
were
so
professional
sweet
If
lived
in
AZ
this
would
be
only
place
go
My
mother
sister
also
enjoyed
there
as
well
HIGHLY
RECOMMEND
We
only
came
here
for
a
pool
party
with
an
event
that
was
in
town
I
would
of
gave
it
more
stars
however
the
shark
tank
slide
closed
and
they
failed
to
mention
that
looked
over
saw
sitting
on
side
fish
empty
It
real
bummer
event
Was
looking
forward
taking
swim
near
sharks

I've

and
the

I
live
2
minutes
away
from
Taiyo
so
gave
it
a
shot
was
skeptical
at
first
because
didn't
think
this
place
will
be
any
good
especially
when
it's
in
the
boonies
but
pleasantly
surprised
The
sashimi
fresh
which
extremely
important
and
their
rolls
were
tasty
decor
is
still
quite
new
It's
clean
modern
looking
with
booths
such
would
recommend
if
you're
NW
do
not
wanting
to
drive
far
for
decent
sushi
pricing
bit
steep
sushi
expect
pay
more
Great
customer
service
but
food
is
garbage
I
got
red
velvets
and
whoever
said
this
the
best
lied
They
taste
plain
with
sour
tasting
raspberry
sauce
on
top
along
strawberries
Also
my
mom
ordered
bacon
kid
you
not
it
bacon
looks
like
a
sausage
bunch
of
fat
it
Only
giving
them
two
stars
because
the
lettuce
wraps
are
always
good
and
server
was
nice
Can't
remember
his
name
but
very

Our

almost
45
minutes
Mongolian
Beef
super
dry
scallions
were
wilted

old
Ginger
chicken
watery
bland
Both
only
look
warm
like
they
sitting
under

Rice
not
hot
either
Never
saw
a
manager
either
we
there
2
hours
Needless
to
say
lack
of
attention
showed
Fantastic
food
great
service
at
a
price
It
doesn't
get
any
better
than
Salvadoreno
Well
done
I
cant
wait
to
go
back
They
have
limited
restaurants
and
the
one
we
ordered
from
they
called
35
mins
later
to
tell
us
stopped
working
with
them
Every
time
used
them
made
a
mistake
Not
worth
it
All
pick
up
Do
it
yourself
I've
learned
there
are
several
food
trucks
under
this
name
but
I
have
only
been
to
the
one
outside
RJC
on
3rd
Street
had
a
5-Speed
breakfast
burrito
morning
that
was
AMAZING
don't
think
I'll
eat
anywhere
else
before
work
It
eggs
hash
browns
bacon
ham
sausage...delicious
The
girl
in
truck
is
very
nice
too
and
they
take
phone
orders
case
you
want
wait
cold
for
your
food
love

Jien
Jang
Mien
Noodles
were
great
Friendly
staff
and
reasonable
prices
Will
return
again
I
was
very
skeptical
of
this
place
because
am
normally
not
a
fan
strip
center
Mexican
food
places
This
location
isn't
the
newest
and
nicest
but
it
is
definitely
solid
joint
far
exceeded
my
expectations
Our
server/waiter
fast
friendly
courteous
The
chips
salsas
brought
to
table
when
you
sit
down
were
fresh
excellent
especially
loved
red
one
bought
pint
take
home
put
on
EVERYTHING
There
just
enough
spice
great
flavor
some
secret
ingredient
can't
it
We
also
ordered
melted
cheese
thing
for
an
appetizer
awesome
cheesy
goodness
Next
time
we
are
going
order
with
green
chilies
My

Service
and
staff
were
great
Very
friendly
accommodating
However
The
food
was
awful
atmosphere
OK
for
the
prices
I
expected
a
Lil
more
elegant
space
From
outside
it
seems
upscale
on
inside
feels
like
comfortable
dive
type
bar
Seems
as
though
they're
trying
to
create
an
upscale
menu
Scottsdale
but
falls
short
in
atmosphere

Possibly
there

But
We

don't
waste

Had

24th
birthday
dinner
here
one
of
times
I
came
restaurant
surprised
me
with
a
delicious
complimentary
cake
The
staff
was
sweetest
Portions
are
big
and
price
is
good
Wait
staff
can
be
a
little
frustrating
to
deal
with
The
actual
pics
of
the
food
need
updated
as
they
hard
view
I
stand
corrected
this
establishment
does
make
its
own
noodles
as
evidenced
by
the
t-shirts
servers
wear
and
owner
contacted
me
after
my
last
review
went
back
and
tried
Yokohama
ramen
which
certainly
has
a
different
broth
taste
but
is
served
with
curly
noodles
preferred
these
it's
nice
al
dente
mouth
feel
I
don't
know
a
more
convenient

when

i
recently
bought
a

same
about
their

department
was
cash
buyer
dealt
two
people

not
recall
name
of
first
but
second
Jeff
well
he
upset
to
have
deal
me
since
there
no
commission
for
him
They
only
make
money
on
financing
or

Since
buyer
incentive
even
be
polite
He
straight
up
lied
accepting

wanted

Later

considering
writing
bad

did
want

informed
him
salesman

and
in

is

demeanor
incentivized
by

felt
like

nothing
could
go

comments
made
me...but

what
end...just

however
if
you

I

here
for
a

birthday
which
consisted
of
smorgasbord
different
appetizers
Usually

and
though
I'm
open
to

it's

This

here
We
got
Road
Special
with
crawfish
clam
and

Great
food
friendly
service
I
will
also
note
that
this
place
was
kept
very
clean
which
important
for
any
restaurant
particularly
restaurants
serving
seafood
If
I
could
give
this
place
zero
stars
would
We've
eaten
here
a
number
of
times
as
you
can
see
that
is
an
updated
review
the
fact

almost
empty
should
have
been
our
first
clue
Went
with
friends
because
guys
wanted

Server

and
brought

Since
my
friend
didn't
want
burgers
we
opted
for

special
day

spinach
steak
salad
Sounded
good
it
said
there
were
tons
things
in
it
The
server
asked
how

Here's
a
tip
don't
eat
here
The
food
was
bland
and
cold
cheese
in
the
enchilada
wasn't
even
melted
It
tortilla
full
of
cold
shredded
cheese
Also
refried
beans
were
awful

I've
had
instant
that
held
their
consistency
better
We
waited
20
minutes
for
this
food
there
only
three
other
occupied
tables
is
place
ever
been
to
when
you
order

salsa
puts
salsa
ON

If
can
call
it
chopped
tomato
onion
with
cilantro
barely
qualifies
as
Pico
de

sure
hell
isn't
salsa
But
thanks
making
my
chips
soggy
This
first
Filiberto's
to
I'll
try
another
just
rule
out
one
pathetic
location
I'm
never
going
back

We
were
looking
for
a
nice
hearty

dinner
and
stumbled
upon
this

Location

Yoo-Hooooo
since
us
girls
love
jap
cusine
and
stayed
at
the
Cosmo
naturally
we
had
to
try
this
place
It's
right
outside
of
Marquee
on
top
floor
so
if
that's
where
you
are
headed
ordered
a
bunch
rolls
wagyu
beef
with
lovely
presentation...sadly
it
no
taste

stew
fried
rice
was
great
though
sashimi
is
in
singular
slices
Our
cocktails
were
strong
enough
but
not
over
bearing
our

out

it's

food
Saturday
night
Oh
yah
place
very
savvy/contemporary
dark
After
my
sister
told
me
about
her
great
experience
here
getting
hair
colored
by
Keturah
I
decided
to
give
a
try
with
next
haircut
made
appointment
for
4:00
but
because
of
some
miscommunication
she
saw
someone
else
before
I
think
he
was
regular
so
didn't
get
started
on
until
4:30
A
little
frustrating
it
got
instantly
better
is
an
absolute
sweetheart
the
drastic
cut
wanted
about
6ish
inches
and
asked
couple
times
if
really
what
wanted
It
nice
be
cautious
showed
pictures
Pinterest
knew
exactly
do
usually
find
haircuts
awkward
feel
super
comfortable
fun
talk
to
At
end
even
demonstrated
how
style
newly
medium-length
hair
have
lot
took
more
than
hour
wash
cut
pleasantly
surprised
when
total
came
out
40
Very
reasonable
especially
all
time
spent
Definitely
coming
back
trim
Went
to
Reid's
for
Easter

Sunday
Brunch
25
all
you
can
eat
buffet
style
brunch
Options
were
pretty
good
eggs
and
quiche
pancakes
french
toast
omelet
station
carved
prime
rib
Honestly
we
wanted
try
some
of
everything
and
got
close
The
best
part
was
that
great
Like
really
good
Given
there
are
pop-up
Brunches
60
is
a
solid
option
the
holiday
Even
normal
brunch
here
decent
value
My
only
issue
it's
very
small
one
I'd
like
Mimosa
special
It
doesn't
have
be
bottom-less
but
I'm
that
but
maybe
3
mimosa
or
something...help
me
help
you
Still
great
place
check
out
I
enjoyed
the
food
and
healthy
options
Atmosphere
is
a
little
different
but
it
was
cool
So
I
go
into
this
walmart
on
Thomas
at
8:30
last
night
am
always
reluctant
to
use
a
cart
or
basket
for
fear
of
what
I'll
catch
so
when
do
grab
few
cleaning
towels
and
wipe
down
the
object

None
there
The
lady
who
was

while

down
turned
away
as
fumbling
among
empty
containers
gave

probably
already

shopped
gawked

asked
couple
employees
questions
that
they
couldn't
comprehend

Came

We

From

while

claims
not

it

tale

Another

avoid

This
mall
is
in
the

On
my
way
to

I
get
a
lovely

For

So
glad
to
have
it
in
Arcadia
Blown
away
by
the
decor
This
coffee
shop
was
fairly
new
when
we
visited
and
very
quiet
We
arrived
in
evening
place
pretty
empty
The
decor
is
amazing
good
Unfortunately
I
loving
vibe
couches
soo
much
forgot
to
take
photos
of
our

would
be
a
great
for
date
meeting
or
group
study

isn't
quiet
but
space
immaculate
huge
It's
all
rustic

too
it's
just
gorgeous
there
are

Great
little
off

So
I
am
not
sure
if
and
the
below
dinners
ate
at
same
place
or
perhaps
restaurant
has
cleaned
up
its
act
We
here
last
night
during
AZ
Restaurant
week
did
opt
for
5
course
additionally
added
in
Foie
Gras
15
Cheese
Plate
10
were
extremely
pleased
with
our
server
found
him
to
be
friendly
attentive
very
knowledgeable
The
food
was
excellent
loved
knowing
what
might
come
out
next
one
flat
disappointing
dish
Escargot
Empinada
filling
too
over
whelming
delicate
escargot
All
got
was...maybe
lemon
zest

exactly
sure
enjoy
experience
would
return
My
only
concern
we
opted
instead
of
4
so
that
additional
10
then
from
there
also
chose
as
indicated
above
But
still
courses
in-essence
cheese
cost
20
35...that
is
rather
excessive
thought
these
addition
5th
course
Oh
well
live
learn
will
return
despite
this
confusion

My
large
and
rowdy
group
of
friends
rolled
in
around
2:30am
with
cravings
Sorry
we
were
so
loud
Wait

great
accommodating
this
very
rude

If

inappropriate
sexual
things
that
may
or
not
disturb
other

place
will
still
kick
you
out
Believe

great
Do

Both

said
those
two
items
gross
However
I

heard
Poke

The

Although
making

Marc

Thank
you
Erik
and
Christina
are
wonderful
We
have
used
storage
companies
since
2007
for
almost
10
years
between
Phoenix
San
Diego
by
far
they
been
like
a
loving
family
No
matter
what
the
situation
we
came
upon
worked
with
us
to
help
get
our
Hooray
Erik
This
is
honestly
one
of
my
favorite
hands
on
cooking
classes
My
husband
and
I
have
went
to
two
classes
so
far
they
are
amazing
You
learn
much
the
small
you
basically
your
sous
chef
helping
out
We
made
what
we
learned
for
parties
And
our
guests
love
dishes
as
well
Make
sure
take
containers
an
appetite
The
instructors
very
accommodating
even
changes
accommodate
vegetarians
We
are
here
visiting
from
Canada
and
we
just
did
the
9:30
body
step
class
it
was
awesome
The
instructor
great
other
women
in
were
super
friendly
welcoming
will
definitely
be
back
Horrible
property
managers
I
agree
with
most
of
the
other
posters
this
company
seems
to
be
underhanded
when
it
comes
charging
renters
doubt
their
owners
know
they
are
pocketing
money
in
names
all
petty
and
fraudulent
charges
come
up
with
Do
not
rent
from
them
I
have
such
good
memories
of
Swensen's
we
used
to
go
there
when
was
a
little
kid
Anyway
so
the
BF
his
family
and
went
here
for
ice
cream
tonight
mom's
birthday
It
ok
remember
it
being
better
We
got
banana
split
but
lacking
some
flavor
All
toppings
were
more
watery
than
remember
Of
course
still
good....just
nothing
special
His
mom
caramel
brownie
sundae
that
pretty
tasty
dad
bonanza
which
looked
good
The
service
slow
fine
prices
are
really
high
especially
mediocre
quality
cream
just
wish
like
sigh
Absolutely
love
their
brunch
menu
Enchiladas
and
eggs
are
so
good
My
friends
breakfast
burrito
more
than
anyone
else's
If
you
like
your
Bloody
Mary
spicy
will
absolutely
the
options
they
have
They're
each
served
with
a
small
appetizer
paired
to
drink
favorites
come
stuffed
jalapeno
or
beef
stick
The
downside
is
that
this
place
always
packed
AND
won't
take
reservations
This
costs
them
star
because
we
have
driven
out
of
our
way
eat
here
only
be
turned
away
by
ridiculously
long
wait
times
Came
by
with
some
vintage
treasures
to
sell
and
what
a
delightful
experience
Stormy
gave
me
welcoming
smile
won
over
her
kindness
She
was
very
knowable

knew
would
work
best
for
customers
paid
great
price
every
item
she
could
use

I'm
hoping
I
can
find
more
help
out
others
Great
1950's
vibe
outfits
concert
going
bling
things
galore
shoe

too
I've
been
a
Bell
Honda
customer
for
almost
20
years
have
purchased
9
vehicles
from
them
and
always
treated
well
Until
now
My
husband
I
both
in
December
2015
while
the
process
was
simple
I'm
beyond
frustrated
with
how
since
then
told
could
apply
refund
on
my
trade-in
registration
only
to
find
out
put
hold
it
transferred
that
money
new
vehicle
without
knowledge
Not
not
aware
of
this
neither
were
salesman
or
financier
spent
two
months
trying
rectify
this
get
200
back
runaround
million
broken
I'll
call
you
back
promises
At
point
it's
200
principle
Essentially
they
stole
me
refuse
talk
about
it
Needless
say
just
lost
loyal
customer
The
worst
Literally
I
regret
bringing
my
wife's
car
in
here
today
had
bad
luck
with
their
detail
service
a
few
years
ago
but
didn't
think
they
would
screw
up
regular
wash
Wrong
They
wipe
down
the
interior
completely
and
vacuum
cargo
area
opened
it
minutes
found
piles
of
potting
soil
back
there
So
guy
who
vacuumed
couldn't
be
bothered
to
do
his
job
guys
did
care
enough
say
or
anything
about
wouldn't
if
offered
me
free
washes
for
life
Never
coming
back
The
Pastor
Vampiros
was
outstanding
I

I
had
heard
this
place
was
great
so
decided
to
give
it
a
shot
for
lunch
Wow
The
food
and
there
SO
much
of
it
went
with
friend
we
split
an
order
babaganoush
Delilah
We
each
got
the
lunch
special
chicken
Kevin
rice
It
also
came
soup
salad
all
walked
out
paying
10
each
will
be
back
no
doubt
about
3.5
stars
for
our
maiden
visit
When
we
return
it
will
be
to
check
out
their
menudo
and
pozole
I
round
up
4
anyplace
that
serves
pozole
all
week
long
Plus
they
are
SUPER
nice
in
there
place
is
clean
new
family
run

so
why
not
give
them
a
bit
of
break
We
both
got
sopapillas
really
just
large
tostada
using
large
flat
fry
bread
as
the
base
one
red
chile
green
The
base
itself
was
five
star
great
flavored
beef
refried
bean
toppings
were
solid
four
stars
But
then
bury
tasty
goodness
with
heaping
mound
shredded
iceberg
lettuce
lots
poor
quality
unmelted
pre-shredded
yellow
cheese
hate
that
wanted
scrap
off
cheese
I
don't
like
call
those
bits
by
anything
other
than
real
food
name
which
TYC
tasteless
crap
you
know
put
TYC
on
everything
at
Taco
Bell
Bell
My
critique
squeeze
bottle
green
sauces
brought
table
sauce
separates
heavier
parts
sinking
down
bottom
watery
liquid
rising
top
what
comes
us
mostly
liquid
That
WHY
scoop
salsa
verde
serve
little
bowl
rather
stick
plastic
bottle
These
folks
serving
correctly
too
vinegary
my
tastes
prefer
more
or
smokey
flavor
sauce
hope
I'll
make
point
checking
fall
when
it's
slightly
less
160
degrees
outside
would
support
these
folks
can't
get
behind
items
buried
TYC
First
time
we
tried
Yasu
did
the
Chef's
choice
and
it
was
amazing
best
sushi
in
PH
Tonite
came
for
our
anniversary
again
but
We
chefs
2
a
half
hours
had
3
Hashim
dishes
piece
of
cod
two
shrimp
left
to
stop
eat
somewhere
else
The
chef
apologized

but
no
consideration
made
160
tab
Couple
next
us
who
ordered
off
menu
were
out
very
happy
Not
gonna
rock
your
socks
off
but
a
decent
choice
If
you're
too
lazy
to
leave
the
house
definitely
one
of
best
delivery
options
in
Rhodes
Ranch
area
Sauce
is
fresh
tasting
and
good
semi-sweet
flavor
Toppings
are
quality
little
on
skimpy
side
The
thin
crust
super
cracker
kind
which
I
like

just
clarifying
since
some
other
local
places
not
very
thin
roma
sprinkle
salty
parmesan
was
good
Delivery
fast
friendly
Terrible
service

messed
our
order
up
three
times
Philly
sliders
were
cold
Nachos
have
squeeze
cheese
and
cold
chicken
Can't
understand
why
they
can't
deliver
on
such
a
tiny
menu
if
simple
bar
food
Manager
was
unprofessional
saving
seats
for
his
personal
friends
as
waitresses
trying
to
seat
guests
I
don't
golf
but
my
son
is
taking
lessons
here
and
so
can't
judge
the
course
There
double
layer
driving
range
with
some
seating
areas.it
an
awesome
view
as

We
bought
sons
clubs
because
first
place
we
went
to
basically
blew
us
off
am
happy
did
person
that
helped
was
kind
patient
Lessons
are
going
great
The
employees
have
encountered
nice
Excellent
smoothies
The
Panama
and
the
Strawberry
Nomad
were
huge
hits
Will
definitely
be
coming
back
here
again
I
stayed
at
the
Four
Queens
for
6
nights
and
was
very
pleased
with
my
room
They
told
me
it
a
recently
remodeled
room
nice
like
south
tower
in
930
The
bathroom
is
on
small
size
but
not
bad
clean
bed
comfortable
too
People
have
to
take
into
consideration
that
this
an
older
hotel
rooms
are
used
almost
every
night
heard
little
outside
noise
from
Fremont
street

is
SO
good
If

Everytime

Wowza
I
can't
believe
it's
taken
me
3
years
in
Charlotte
to
make
it
this
place
From
the
minute
looked
at
their
menu
online
was
drooling
over
food
Finally
made
last
night

my
wedding
anniversary

Upon
being

we
were
greeted
by

My

I
went
in
to
upgrade
our
phones
set
up
my
son
on
old
I-phone
4s
We
were
greeted
promptly
by
Eddie
who
was
very
polite
professional
His
knowledge
of
the
various
options
enabled
us
get
into
new
add
for
less
than
what
we
expected
out
quickly
very
important
when
you
are
with
two
children
overall
it
a
great
experience
I
have
been
using
this
store
for
years
it
has
a
Canada
post
outlet
inside
just
like
all
the
others
noticed
in
last
few
months
prices
their
grocery
products
can
beat
out
some
of
major
stores
The
girls
at
cosmetic
area
are
great

don't
forget
to
ask
your
free
sample

Just
an
update
on
the
previous
review
As
you
can
see
I
posted
review
and
they
responded
quickly
That
is
much
appreciated
spoke
with
one
of
managers
who
apologized
profusely
for
our
bad
experience
He
explained
about
carpets
said
were
going
to
get
bottom
food
issues
at
table
What
should've
mentioned
in
first
was
that
server
great
She
very
friendly
have
them
extra
star
customer
service
will
wait
until
a
later
date
give
more
stars
overall
While
researching
tattoo
shops
while
I

in

came
across

and
decided
wanted
to
come
check
it
out
hoping
for
a
walk
appointment
but
they
were
able
squeeze
me
the
next
day
After
seeing
how
awesome
shop
great
atmosphere
absolutely
willing
wait
it
Both

receptionists
super

got
my

Dr
Le
is
a
comforting
humble
doctor
Most
importantly
he's
there
to
listen
I
would
come
back
and
have
so
I
have
now
been
here
twice
the
food
is
delicious
and
flavourful
It
a
small
outlet
in
business
park
area
along
Dufferin
St
it
usually
busy
during
weekdays
when
there
with
workers
from
area
The
chicken
kafta

are
heaping
portions
come
served
warm

hummus
of
authentic
Lebanese
kind
hole
corner
From
what
know
to

Wonderful
place
course
will
be
back
We
found
this
place
wandering
around
looking
for
lunch
The
decor
is
a
bit
cheesy
including
Pope
room
with
domed
roof
menu
if
family
style
aka
everything
super
big
ordered
one
appetizer
and
entree
to
share
couldn't
finish
everything
Eggplant

was
very
good
Food
presentation

McClintock
Animal
Care
is
by
far
the
best
vet
we've
ever
taken
our
Amy
to
Being
a
chocolate
lab
she's
been
to
many
vets
She's
very
active
dog
who
not
too
concerned
with
her
own
well
being
She
tends
play
hard
and
hurt
herself
from
time
time
McClinktock
has
care
of
her
I
trust
them
completely
my
dog
that's
saying
lot
From
front
desk
nurses
vets
themselves
you
can
tell
get
go
they
actually
about
your
pet
They
will
sit
on
floor
let
smell
them
know
even
give
few
kisses
explain
everything
do
treatment
options
why
it's
best
This
important
me
want
that
they're
recommending
something
because
proven
just
make
money
Unfortunately
some
are
like
that
But
NOT
this
place
would
never
take
pupp
anywhere
else
I
highly
recommend
the
Skin
Center
and
specifically
Nellie
for
botox
injections
She
is
best
If
you're
looking
polite
professional
low-pressure
Center
you

Koren
food
The
flavours
are
good
for
the

sizes
and

reasonable
only
thing
however
that
service
lacking
Not
mention
I
was
given
wrong

change
I
short
10
didn't
realize
until
it
too
late
If
you're
expecting
great
service
wouldn't
say
this
place
it
however
food
really
good
They
also
have
daily
bibimbap
specials
believe
I
used
to
do
an
internship
in
the
area
and
only
thing
that
made
it
bearable
was
fact
can
walk
Whole
Foods
at
lunch
shop
eat
they
have
best
salad
bar
Yes
know
people
call
this
place
whole
paycheque"...but
is
Yorkville
Of
course
expensive
At
least
there
free
parking
don't
buy
anything
cheaper
somewhere
else
not
everything
more
expensive
there
For
price
you
are
paying
getting
convenience
of
having
incredible
selection
organic
fruits
vegetables
with
selections
just
can't
find
anywhere
else...and
they
offer
all
year-round
When
go
other
supermarkets
stuff
sometimes
look
kind
sad
or
bruised
especially
winter
but
that's
case

Another
great
about
their
amazing

I've
been
gradually
switching
my
beauty

natural

a

resource
Not
will
make
recommendations
also
send
home
loads
samples
My
wish
open
locations
Toronto...hopefully
one
near
me
This
place
is
very
good
but
it
almost
a
little
too
sweet
The
waffles
alone
have
globs
of
sugar
in
them
and
then
you
put
spreads
ice
cream
berries
on
top
I
never
had
anything
like
it
can
only
manage
once
long
while
Delicious
my
mouth
not
when
hits
stomach
I
purchase
all
of
my
volleyball
gear
here
If
you
can't
find
it
here
doesn't
exist
The
place
has
a
huge
selection
and
have
only
ever
had
great
service
They
often
many
styles
shoes
on
sale
last
year's
models
but
who
cares
love
the
bags
they
give
when
checkout
use
them
as
bag
Delicious
breakfast
here
with
super
friendly
service
Breakfast
potatoes
are
classic
like
your
grandma
would
make
So
good
Generous
potions
Good
bang
for
buck
We'll
definitely
be
back
Waitress
terrific
our
three
year
old
too

If
you
can't
stand
the
smell
of
stinky
tofu
then
don't
come
here
Otherwise
enjoy
some
hot
and
tasty
beef
noodle
soup
while
trying
to
cover
your
nostrils
Basically
whole
restaurant
smells
like
since
they
cook
a
lot
in
kitchen
but
if
can
get
over
smell
is
pretty
dang
good
I
also
ate
there
was
nothing
special
about
it
While
I
was
home
sick
today
my
boyfriend
ordered
some
food
for
me
just
before
he
left
work
the
afternoon
surprised
because
didn't
tell
it
so
it
delightful
to
see
a
gentlemen
at
door
holding
milkshake

bag
of
food
My
knows
pretty
well
hit
nail
on
hammer
with
ordering
chocolate
peanut
butter
milkshake
which
still
very
cold
creamy
excellent
He
also
got
slice
apple
pie
warm
delicious
But
when
came
down
opening
large
box
realized
something
had
went
wrong
It
box
cheesy
bacon
fries
Normally
most
people
that
would
be
an
awesome
mistake
no
one
really
care
seemingly
everyone
loves
bacon
Unfortunately
am
rare
few
individuals
who
doesn't
not
enjoy
always
pick
out
or
off
things
give
boyfriend
them
credit
fries
were
crispy
hot
covered
in
tillamook
cheddar
generously
doused
big
hunks
tried
eat
pieces
but
flavor
infused
melty
cheese
closed
put
refrigerator
eat
warmed
up
under
broiler
loved
upset
they
deliver
his
original
request
CARNE
ASADA
fries
Despite
this
mix
up
portions
generous
arrived
quickly
did
make
day
opened
apartment
milkshake
Especially
while
feeling
weather
brighten
day
live
close
place
think
we
will
check
more
time
least
what
it's
all
about
want
carne
asada
have
Mexican
burgers
The
pie
legit
from
far
turn
personally
Great
food
Four
of
us
had
a
tower
chowder
cakes
slaw
fresh
lobster
mussels
real
fish

chips
Would
be
5
star
but
service
was
pokey
This
is
a
lot
of
money
for
half
hour
view
the
city
It
was
supposed
to
be
romantic
but
we
got
stuck
on
there
with
two
very
intoxicated
people
who
were
loud
and
kept
talking
us
Ugh
I
think
they
need
lower
prices
sure
as
drunk
people
don't
have
solution
Guess
that's
just
Vegas
The
best
Greek
food
I
have
had
since
being
back
stateside
lived
in
Germany
15
years
and
besides
Greece
no
better
place
to
get
these
Wow
they
brought
me
the
good
old
days
Thanks
for
wonderful
locale
try
everything
nothing
bad
choose
from
The
food
here
is
very
good
I
have
had
the
pad
thai
drunken
noodles
and
am
completely
in
love
with
yellow
curry
try
to
order
other
things
but
seem
be
drawn
that
dish
would
not
expected
find
such
good
area
was
wrong
There
a
lack
of
dine
eating
take
it
home
staff
pleasant
Really
small
sushi
for
the
price
Quality
is
as
it
should
be
higher
end
restaurant
but
Nigiris
are
half
size
of
other
places
For
same
price
I
can
get
better
deal
at
even
Morimoto
Service
acceptable
One
of
Charlotte's
must
go
to
places
Unless
your
in
Raleigh
or
Orlando
visit
them
there
This
location
is
the
original
They
found
a
great
way
fuse
sushi
and
burgers
yes
I
said
that
correctly
Burgoshi
what
it's
called
amazing
You
can
get
as

also
have
spiked

it
They

not
busy
this
Sunday
afternoon
07/07/2013
We
walked
in
greeted
warmly
The
food
took
a
while
to
cook
but
they
brought
out
the
crispy
Shoestring
fries
for
us
snack
on
wings
are
MUCH
larger
than
those

Well

sizes
won
over
fact
it's

loud
over

with
other
well-known
establishments
Was
in
town
for
the
weekend
this
place
didn't
disappoint
The
omlettes
were
on
point
and
I
would
suggest
yogurt
bowl
as
well
Service
was
fine
food
came
out
quickly
getting
there
earlier
a
Saturday/Sunday
if
you
don't
like
to
wait
others
finish
up
Awesome
place
One
look
at
the
bagels
I
had
to
order
some
ended
up
with
Everything
bagel
The
best
part
was
it
just
got
out
of
oven
It
nice
and
hot
Completed
my
two
cups
black
coffee
Nice
strong
smooth
coffee
too
Be
careful
extremely
hot
Took
awhile
cool
down
Price
spot
on
forget
how
much
but
i
thought
super
reasonable
My
girlfriend
friend
ordered
sesame
They
were
jealous
that
mine
hot
their
bagel
room
temperature
some
pretty
good
Nice
chewy
texture
compared
America
place
would
be
great
for
a
lazy
morning
breakfast/early
lunch
There
are
tables
inside
outside
covered
patio
place
say
is
oddly
juxtaposed
grittiness
Kensington
Market
guess
they
going
through
gentrification/urban
revitalization
now
so
establishments
like
this
will
bound
pop
up
Good
find
me
friends
Ordered
the
eight
piece
spicy
chicken
meal
with
cole
slaw
and
biscuits
We
also
ordered
a
large
side
of
French
fries
to
go
our
meal
The
were
die
for
Hot
crispy
place
was
hectic
for
it
really
busy
Our
came
out
correct
everything
tasted
fresh
One
thing
that
did
bug
me
if
you
want
any
dipping
sauces
they
will
charge
30
cents
So
next
time
al
just
bring
my
own
ranch
from
home
least
can
do
is
give
one
free
Do
as
the
locals
do
That's
what
brought
us
to
Winchell's
for
dinner
It
has
usual
pub
fare

burgers
sandwiches
meat
and
greasy
appetizers
And
they
did
it
all
well
just
enough
add
my
could
go
again
list
I
think
that's
an
important
list
be
on
What
really
put
this
on
map
pleasantly
surprised
me
was
steak
tender
flavorful
not
rough
stringy
meat
usually
have
at
pub/brewery/restaurant
type
places
It's
totally
out
of
way
off
strip
more
than
tourists
but
if
you're
looking
some
food
want
avoid
crowds
is
a
good
option
consider
We
were
looking
for
a
new
weekend
breakfast
place
and
this
is
it
This
has
it
all
Atmosphere
service
good
food
The
wait
staff
friendly
attentive
My
coffee
or
water
glass
never
went
below
half
food
came
quickly
was
very
good
definitely
old
school
diner
like
but
with
the
added
fun
of
airport
setting
I
will
see
you
there
next
Saturday
morning
One
word....Delicious
The
Pain
Perdue
was
amazing..so
light
and
fluffy
for
what
looked
like
going
to
be
a
dense
banana
brownie
covered
in
syrup...and
the
sausage
had
little
kick
that
evened
out
sweetness
And
Morning
Moonshine
great
with
almond
milk
My
boyfriend
Orchard
French
Toast
which
also
delicious
biscuits
gravy
smelled
so
good
place
super
cute
guys
work
behind
counter
were
really
nice
I
don't
go
downtown
much
but
if
am
down
there
again
around
breakfast
definitely
stop
Great
job
The
service
and
selection
is
good
Their
steak
lacking
food
was
prompt
very
flavorful
Pricing
average
reason
to
come
here
the
atmosphere
Being
on
a
Hockey
night
place
hoping
I
would
recommend
again
Doc's
is
a
dangerous
find
We
love
supporting
local
businesses

this
one
easy
to
support
family
run
business
their
passion
for
product
evident
in
every
single
bite
supplies
resorts
restaurants
we
feel
very
lucky
that
they
started
selling
retail
Every
flavor
unique

although
haven't
yet
tried
all
of
flavors
the
ones
have
are
best
ever
They
an
European
approach
using
only
high
quality
ingredients
Can't
wait
try
new
flavors
we
went
to
slate
bistro
while
visiting
some
friends
in
pittsburgh

what
a
great
meal
every
appetizer
salad
entree
and
dessert
was
outstanding
the
fried
calamari
steak
not
normal
rings
baby
squids
amongst
best
i've
ever
had
as
were
scallops
though
being
that
they
change
their
menu
very
frequently
i
can't
say
they'll
be
there
when
you
go
DESSERTS
key
lime
cheese
cake
nutella
mouse
AMAZING
add
this
place
list
of
things
miss
about
city
Decent
place
decent
food
Nothing
more
Just
a
regular
sport
bar
The
humus
was
bland
the
Hungry
Monk
Tripple
nothing
as
described
but
an
average
to
small
sandwich
far
from
being
pilled
with
meat
A
bit
overpriced
for
what
offered
Three
cheese
Quesadilla
remember
also
place
is
enjoyed
by
locals
yet
I
would
recommend
if
traveling
and
looking
special
eat
I've
been
looking
for
a
good
pizza
place
since
moving
here
from
Ohio
last
May
Stopped
in
tonight
and
got
to
go
Awesome
taste
of
the
sauce
cheese
pepperoni
Only
negative
thing
I
can
say
is
that
ordered
paid
extra
no
way
was
there
on
it
But
service
friendly
good
so
will
give
it
another
shot
Update

THIS
PLACE
Kristine
was
amazing
today
Super
sweet
and
thouroughly
explained
everything
The
scan
of
my
teeth
fun
neat
to
see
So
excited
for
aligners
I
love
spicy
food
I'm
always
picking
the
menu
items
with
little
pepper
by
their
name
But
spice
at
Naked
Fish's
was
just
WAY
too
much
My
whole
mouth
hurt
And
food
really
average
We
had
taken
a
cab
from
strip
on
recommendation
for
and
it
not
worth
effort
They
were
very
nice
it's
open
late
space
cute
but
we
wouldn't
go
back
It's
so
hard
to
find
a
great
nail
technician
in
town
So
when
I
found
Vicki
down
the
street
from
my
house
was
totally
thrilled
I'm
very
picky
about
way
nails
turn
out
but
who
isn't
chose
because
kept
over
hearing
her
name
being
requested
for
appointments
decided
give
try
From
first
time
met
now
she
is
earth
and
can
relate
customers
by
conversing
with
you
during
whole
not
like
others
don't
talk
you
Great
prices
too
overly
expensive
definitely
pay
right
price
service
get
So
this
Saturday
I
went
in
to
get
7
teeth
pulled
4
wisdom
and
3
other
teeth
From
the
beginning
was
very
nervous
but
staff
made
me
feel
so
comfortable
loved
everything
about
it
also
owner
love
how
she
came
make
sure
ok
talk
my
procedure
with
me
BEST
DENTAL
PLACE
honestly
can't
wait
for
2
check
up
As
seen
on
TV
this
burger
joint
deserved
that
spotlight
and
my
return
visit
The
1st
time
I
ate
here
just
had
to
try
the
brulee
burger...I
know
know...with
so
many
joints
serving
up
burgers
with
burnt
sugar
havarti
egg
how
does
one
choose
who's
king
in
highly
saturated
market
Ha
Just
kidding
obviously
isn't
your
typical
Ronald
McMoney
scene
these
are
people
who
food
service
love
what
they
do
When
a
new
restaurant
usually
limit
toppings
test
true
quality
of
actual
dish
They
have
pizza
place
too
same
shopping
center
btw
haven't
pleasure
trying
but
if
did
I'd
cheese
first
Wet
can
ruin
crust
real
fast
so
trip
got
cheddar
bacon
BBQ
sauce
That's
about
as
plain
make
burger
bun
was
actually
really
good
hint
sweetness
Didn't
notice
due
suger
yum
meat
juicy
flavorful
bun
soft
sweet
very
nice

perfect
half
melt
see

Overall
5
star
for
an
independent
mom
pop
rare
days
They
did
an
Amazing
job
with
my
nails
It
was
first
time
there
and
I
will
definitely
be
going
back
again
Oh
my
god
I
loved
jalapeño
steak
sandwich
The
meat
was
really
soft
and
tasty

Cheesy
juicy
fresh
would
definitely
recommend
this
places
They
gave
me
great
customer
service
too
Love
place

Hands
down
my
favorite
shawarma
joint
Highly
recommend
the

Ordered

experience
at
Canoe
We
went
for
the
Summerlicous
dinner
menu
had
pork
main
cornish
hen
terrine
app
and
ganache

Everything
was
impeccably
plated
as
well
delicious
The

unbelievable
Be

to
order
DIll

Brought
in
a
few
designer
clothes
never
worn...the
woman
had
folded
them
and
then
gave
back
to
me
Said
they
were
not
looking
for
these
items
She
didn't
even
look
at
the
brand's
No
wonder
this
place
has

Kris

was
held
here
tonight
so
it
a
meeting
of
fellow
burger
loving
Yelpers
again
in
the
Mississauga
city
center
area
I
thought
just
ok
This
third
meal
I've
had
last
24
hours
ordered
All
American
which
wasn't
as
big
looked
like
photo
but
overall
liked
it
The
is
2

with
onion

bacon
cheese
and
ketchup
mustard
mayo
Honestly
filling
enough
ate

because
seemed
couldn't
get
enough
them
offered

several
times
all
poutined
out
for
breakfast
sort
my
left
overs
from
night
that
finish
when
at
La

that's
plus
They
have
basically
choice

It

asked

happy
oblige
staff
our
group
nice
meet
some
new
well
Came
to
Chili's
tonight
for
an
easy
night
with
my
daughter
Upon
sitting
down
the
first
thing
noticed
was
that
booth
dirty
Sadly
I
rather
disappointed
over
all
The
service
slow
or
non-existent
not
just
our
table
food
come
out
and
VERY
bland
At
end
when
server
did
up
talk
us
Manager
rudely
interrupted
making
walk
away
No
one
wore
nametags
either
The
problem
with
this
place
is
the
customer
service
It's
so
easy
to
just
fix
a
and
provide
good
When
opposite
provided
flavor
ruined
forever
Others
has
warned
I
didn't
listen
Now
I've
been
burned
too
Disappointed
Under
new
ownership
and
the
prices
have
gone
through
roof
New
Year's

Year

Gourmet
buffet
consists
of
pizza
chicken
strips
After
a
15yr
tradition
I
think
its
time
for
change
I've
been
wanting
to
try
this
place
for
ages
ever
since
I
read
Jessica
T's
review
and
discovered
they
have
Oyster
Shooters
as
part
of
their
AYCE
menu
finally
got
my
chance
at
last
night's
UYE
Thanks

Q
setting
that
up
There
were
about
16
us
sitting
an
elongated
table
It
was
great
meeting
new
faces
conversing
over
good
sushi
Unfortunately
can't
name
everything
we
ate
We
went
omakase
style
i.e
mostly
left
it
up
the
sushi
chef
decide
what
make
next
did
option
order
whatever
wanted
individually
but
opted
just
eat
came
And
boy
I
Pretty
much
came
out
or
very
good
say
anything
blew
me
away
I'd
return
on
strength
experienced
About
them
Shooters
That's
definitely
a
reason
return
A
few
had
couple
rounds
This
actually
first
time
Shooter
in
life
Until
recently
fact
wasn't
into
oysters
Another
Uni
don't
remember
exactly
why
they've
always
avoid
list
However
Cin
recent
persuasion
made
want
give
shot
enjoyed
surprised
how
mild
flavor
was
Quite
contrast
totally
NOT
yummy
look
When
dessert
with
Fried
Banana
banana

Overall

Although
I'm

partial
Yama
Sushi
here
also
like
idea
coming
in
bar
going

Walked
in
and
walked
out
Ten
pm
half
tables
have
chairs
up
Country
music
no
one
greater
us
First
off
respect
the
spicy
levels
are
real
not
like
other
places
where
you
ask
for
10
level
and
it's
even
mild
I
ordered
a
seven
almost
couldn't
finish
it
customer
service
at
an
all-time
high
definitely
would
come
back
My
wife
and
I
only
get
away
so
often
for
a
nice
dinner
Chilfire

very
good
but

service
ok
our
server
pleasant
helpful
which
is
most
important
me
Strangest
thing
there
an
older
woman
at
hostess
stand
appeared
dressed
down
taking
from
higher
dollar
feel
place
altogether
Next
time
if
want
spend
bit
extra
dinner
will
likely
go
Dresslers
few
miles
down
road
Any
place
that
opens
up
their
patio
just
so
I
can
eat
with
my
dogs
gets
an
automatic
5
stars
but
the
food
and
service
deliver
too
My
sister
tried
last
summer
when
we
were
staying
downtown
remember
it
being
a
great
breakfast
delicious
coffee
friendly
hip
servers
suggested
to
husband
during
our
most
recent
Vegas
trip
We
had
called
see
if
they
allowed
on
patio
The
person
phone
said
was
closed
due
cold
weather
she
could
accommodate
us
When
got
there
hostess
directed

weird
If
replaced
them
plantains
would
be
knockout
Awesome
BBQ
The
best
meal
in
Vegas
thus
far
Excellent
sides
like
the
bacon
potato
salad
beans
and
collard
greens
What
a
great
experience
Talk
about
not
judging
book
by
it's
cover
If
you
judge
this
place
simply
the
outside
were
so
wrong
Such
food
and
portions
ginormous
The
service
was
impeccable
we
will
definitely
be
coming
back
I
saw
a
few
people
post
on
social
media
about
this
place
and
decided
to
try
it
for
lunch
today
had
the
southwest
wrap
was
really
tasty
HUGE
It's
been
hours
I'm
still
full
also
couple
bites

If
we
ever
find
ourselves
in
Vegas
again
we'll
definitely
return
to
The
Desert
Rose
I
decided
to
go
by
for
a
late
lunch
and
dining
alone
is
no
big
deal
its
liitle
after
2p
made
it
there
b4
they
closed
i
have
mixed
feeling
about
this
place
the
food
far
excellent
ordered
yellow
curry
nice
healthy
chucks
of
potatoes

carrot
onions
bell
peppers
came
with
little
tin
rice
just

Today

took
forever

Took

yeah

Lots
parking
but
heard
breakins
too
since
you
cannot
watch
your
car
blocked
out
their
windows
Egg

is
amazing
place
to
eat
a
healthy
breakfast
Great
protein
portions
I'm
definitely
regular
here
and
would
like
give
them
some
credit..The
staff
attentive
Most
likely
come
after
good
workout
session
Tried
the
pancakes
Very
good
Bacon
was
way
too
burnt
and
cold
We
will
go
back
again
skip
bacon
For
Thanksgiving
this
year
my
husband
and
I
decided
to
take
the
easy
route
ordered
family
feast
from
Lucille's
While
there
were
no
complaints
about
actual
food
overall
experience
left
a
lot
be
desired
Disappointment
1
When
tried
order
other
Lucille's
was
told
they
sold
out
don't
reside
on
side
of
town
so
very
rarely
go
any
businesses
at
Red
Rock
but
since
had
option
placed
with
location
asked
if
wanted
plates
silverware
pickup
time
2
Over
phone
could
utilize
parking
spots
reserved
for
customers
picking
up
orders
arrived
these
taken
When
left
still
taken
by
same
vehicles
clearly
not
people
pick
orders
These
are
pointless
ended
quite
distance
which
wouldn't
have
been
THAT
terrible
except
3
After
paid
feast
an
employee
needed
assistance
in
hindsight
think
should
obvious
that
would
need
help
carrying
large
heavy
box
food
out
car
However
simply
offering
open
door
me
The
lack
basic
customer
assistance
bit
mind
boggling
leaving
as
struggled
maneuver
car
even
commented
how
thought
someone
helped
4
silverware
needed
Nowhere
found
Not
huge
deal
why
offer
it
you
will
following
through
enjoying
company
friends
Thanksgiving
considered
posting
review
instead
write
corporate
directly
received
call
manager
who
apologized
said
she
hoped
I'd
give
them
another
shot
do
appreciate
time
contact
me
forsee
me
spending
more
money
anytime
soon
I
would
give
this
location
5
stars
for
service
and
ambiance
but
the
food
is
where
have
to
deduct
some
stars
When
order
a
Caesar
not
too
spicy
shouldn't
dilute
it
with
water
in
large
wine
glass
when
arrives
And
my
Tuna
Tacos
were
much
spicy
too
DO
like
things
Maybe
there
should
be
warnings
on
items
heat
Not
everyone
wants
or
can
tolerate

Jonathan+Olivia
is
one
of
the
prettiest
and
newest
stores
on
Ossington
strip
It's
pretty
huge
inside

they've
got
a

They

brands
Cheap
Monday

as
well
high-end
clothing
like

Bone
Helmut

Opening

many

Along

store
they
have
cute
shoes
boots
if
you
head
towards
cash
desk
can
check
out
gorgeous
jewelry
carry
You'll
call
them
are
anything
me
concept
having
gold

makes
want
to
hand
over
your
money
immediately
Too
bad
prices

big
night

This

beautifully

ahead-of-the-trend
carry

you're
looking

Definitely
come
here

Wow
great
food
and
really
good
coffee
amazing
pancakes
upside
down
pinnacle
one
it's
jus
delicious
This
place
was
weird
to
me
There
very
little
wait
As
I
waited
in
the
waiting
area
for
my
table
gentleman
came
out
announce
table
ready
and
let
door
close
face

Then
ordered
a
bacon
cheese
omelette
The
literally
black
omelette
all
shades
of
brown
with
burnt
crust
at
end
It
shape
pancake
thought
this
some
new
retro
gluten
free
crap
they
served
me
by
mistake
Nope
it
My
question
is
why
would
server
serve
something
she
not
approve
of
She
suppose
be
like
coffee
filter
making
sure
grinds
don't
get
pot
Let's
talk
about
because
that's
another
horrid
story
They
should
just
put
sign
on
cup
that
says
Go
Starbucks
do
have
cute
cups
keep
your
glasses
full
Hence
2
stars
Service
sucks
food
life
sucks
If
you
come
here
will
feel
the
same
Oh
yeah
my
friends
chair
is
gonna
fall
apart
I
update
with
a
photo
if
it
does
We
had
the
NY
strip
steak
and
were
very
happy
The
music
was
a
bit
loud
clubbish
which
not
want
we
expecting
Otherwise
nice
dinner
This
is
my
go
to

Next

Very
happy
with
my
first

here
My
brows
were
beat
up
due
to
a
few
months
of
budget
threading
shop
visits
and
in-between
tweezing
Heather
did
great
job
cleaning
them
giving
more
natural
shape
I
was
pleasantly
surprise
the
pricing
It's
bit
than
you'd
pay
for
having
your
manicurist
wax
brow
on
table
at
back
nail
salon
but
you
definitely
get
what
in
both
situations
which
makes
it
worth
price
Wasn't
really
sure
what
to
expect

as
I
had
never
heard
anything
good
or
bad
about
the
place
liked
concept
would
best
describe
it
a
Create
your
own
hibachi
bowl
The
food
was
amazing
and
feel
like
if
wasn't
it's
fault
since
you
picked
went
into
it
love
that
they
have
scallops
can
load
up
with
much
of
whatever
want
At
some
places
think
don't
put
enough
protein
in
too
veggies
vice
versa
We
also
go
appetizers
the
spinach
artichoke
rangoons
which
happy
thought
be
They
seemed

very
clear

Was

Not
a

Had

out
of
my
way
to

but
good
enough

Serves

up

miserable

6
hotdogs
8
small

This
was
the
best

my
life
I
am
not
kidding
The

us
went
with
beef
tasting

added
2
pasta

Wine

I'm
going
to
go
into
lengthy
detail
like
other

here
but
they

They
even
took

Wonderful

All
can
say
is
try

very
very
hungry
D
p.s
One
more
thing
have
this
thing
called

I
stayed
here
while
attending
training
at
CMU
and
thought
it
was
a
very
comfortable
room
for
week
the
cleaning
service
always
done
before
got
back
to
my
room
end
of
day
The
staff
friendly
welcoming
too
Avoid
Used
to
be
good
They
wont
steam
the
crab

you
unless
you're
a

Guess
my

good
enough
them

Decent

We

she
still
got
it

have
been
more
assertive-the
super
rude

but
didn't
want

NEVER

This
place
has
some
of
my
favorite
poke
in

It's
also
one
the
places
I

Definitely
try

Please
save

We

it

fun
for
a
Saturday
afternoon
You
couldn't

The

The
service
was
so
quick
we
didn't
have
to
wait
for
our
food
that
long
and
they
came
as
soon
possible
if

anything
plus
the

a
very
nice
bonus

I
have
heard

As

No

I
read
reviews
on

which
lead
me
to

I
hate
to
spend
a
lot
of
money
on
ice
cream
Especially
when
know
can

price
But
was
out

about
with
my

and
we
went

My
3
favorite
flavors
are
Chocolate
Chip
Mint
Mint
so
guess
what
ordered
Oh
God
that
delicious
Not
sure
how
or
why
but
it
soooo
good
The
hot
fudge
didn't
hurt
either
They
probably
deserve
5
stars
just
little
expensive
that's
ok
We
came
here
after
a
DBacks
game
and
it
was

didn't
take
long
for

which
nice
that
they

The

Money
hungry
I
left
2-3
little
rice
balls
that
game
with
the
sushi
and
they
were
threatening
to
overcharge
BS
We
took
our
little
girl
here
on
a
Sunday
night
as
treat
No
one
was
in
there
but
us
so
that
HUGE
plus
kids
pushing
past
mine
to
get
games
I
unimpressed
with
the
amount
of
games
she
had
blast
trouble
two
employees
came
quickly
fix
problem
and
even
gave
my
daughter
prize
for
game
malfunctioning

I'm
not
big
pizza
lover
really
liked
side
salad
wasn't
too
bad
either
The
cashier
very
friendly
willing
help
It
clean
they
continued
while
we
were
there
Would
only
wish
play
area
be
cleaner
You
could
see
dirt
slides
out
area
All
around
happy
have
pleasant
employees
It's
rare
people
kind
these
says
service
industry
Which
is
shame
Best
steak
I've
ever
had
so
tender
Also
tried
the
Buffalo
chicken
sandwich
which
was
excellent
I
wasn't
too
impressed
with
bacon
club
However
got
onion
rings
and
they
were
best
had
Charming
joint
in
a
sleazy
strip
mall
where
you
underpay
to
be
overfed
Authentic
welcoming
spicy
I
love
it
As
Alex
S
said
below
some
of
the
items
have
too
much
rice
don't
really
recommend
pulao
dishes
for
that
reason
though
lamb
shank
is
delicious
and
yes
finished
Get
something
spicy

soupy
with
naan
Anything
karahi
or
nihari
I
remember
coming
here
when
they
first
opened
and
had
so
many
customer
service
agents
wanting
to
help
you
This
last
trip
no
one
approached
us
ask
if
we
needed
assistance
When
finally
tracked
down
someone
he
was
very
nice
appeared
quite
knowledgeable
about
the
area
that
were
in
Although
didn't
carry
product
needed
apologized
suggested
alternatives
did
carry
I
have
dealing
with
Morrison
Smith
Jewlers
for
eighteen
years
would
not
go
anywhere
else
The
reason
are
these
they
simply
the
best
whether
it
is
buying
a
piece
of
jewelry
that
going
to
be
seen
else
answering
any
questions
you
may
on
looking
at
from
where
came
in
setting
right
down
stone
top
notch
staff
wonderful
and
walk
door
am
always
greeted
by
name
immediately
ask
what
can
do
me
In
this
day
time
get
ripped
off
never
need
worry
them
And
even
when
them
attach
medal
dogs
collar
were
able
meet
no
hesitation
Great
jewlery
good
staff
knowledgable
about
each
adnd
every
have
if
want
find
great
estate
peice
there
one
kind
I
really
enjoy
the
atmosphere
of
this
place
Calm
and
comforting
It's
pretty
pricey
compared
to
other
cafes
However
their
drinks
dessert
are
tasty
fell
in
love
with
Blue
Pea
Lemonade
didnt
ask
what
was
mainly
it
but
presentation
different
I'm
assuming
it
food
coloring
ice
since
didn't
taste
like
anything
when
tried
alone
The
lemonade
all
together
great
My
best
friend
had
order
one
after
trying
mines
Another
drink
I've
White
Chocolate
Lychee
Latte
Which
totally
caught
my
attention
because
white
chocolate
lychee
kind
an
odd
mixed
But
guess
what
It
blended
so
well
together
You
could
definitely
lychee
there
Their
latte
strong
as
which
is
good
for
me
that
drink
pumped
up
Then
we
also
Milo
Toast
thought
it'd
be
very
plain
dull
taste
if
you
added
extra
condensed
it's
something
you'd
devour
fast
see
myself
visiting
place
again
Good
tempura
good
rolls
dragon
california

a
great
neighborhood
place
with
value
for
money
We
go
couple
of
times
month
the
kids
quick
sushi
fix
Very
nice
service
also
bought
party
platters
from
them
and
our
guests
loved
rolls
The
only
issue
I
have
is
that
they
use
far
too
much
mayo

almost
every
special
roll
has
in
it
I'm
not
a
coffee
drinker
but
I
like
my
chai
lattes
They
make
two
types
of
latte
one
with
syrup
and
from
syrup...if
you
guessed
the
non-syrup
correctly
It
has
nice
spicy
taste
sweet
have
it
almond
milk
buttery
flaky
croissant...nomnomnom
are
open
late
which
is
pretty
awesome
during
summer
when
am
walking
dog
in
winter
tired
being
held
up
at
home
cold
It's
cozy
inside
almost
feel
going
there
onesie
pjs
So
smokey
in
there
Cheap
cigar
smokers
Now
I
have
a
sinus
infection

my
only
complaint
If
I
could
give
less
than
1
star
would
Worst
Sonic
ever
This
place
should
be
shut
down
Food
was
wrong
and
tasted
like
it
left
overs
from
last
week
I
have
used
Merle
Norman
cosmetics
since
was
18
My
God
that's
52
years
found
over
the
years
that
customer
service
is
not
same
as
it
back
then
and
miss
Miracol
facials
using
product
daily
like
once
common
practice
That
should
been
named
miracle
because
cleared
up
a
significant
acne
problem
With
passing
of
time
different
products
trouble
remembering
which
products
to
use
in
order
achieve
desired
results
The
consultants
are
every
go
so
no
one
really
knows
my
skin
type
or
specific
issues
don't
often
did....I
be
young
pretty
Now
I'm
old
wrinkled
with
white
hair
comes
from
age
gaining
wisdom
living
am
embarrassed
way
look
now...the
weight
gain
ruddy
complexion
Somewhere
along
line
forgot
take
care
me
will
continuing
customer
although
maybe
Chandler
just
need
guidance
love
products
To
consultants...listen
your
customers
try
deal
each
individual
they
are
Be
knowledgable
kind
supportive
And
make
feel
beautiful
creation
Takes
more
than
great

of
some
advertising

trees
For

would
come

your
home

even
clean
any
needles

This

beats
putting
it

all
over

What
made
better
is
if

an
automatic

My

love
their
jewelry
it's
unique
Excellent
customer
service
would
recommend
this
place
to
anyone
who
looking
everything
quality
ABSOLUTELY
TERRIBLE
I
WENT
HERE
YESTERDAY
MAY
9TH
AND
WAS
CHARGED
62.50
FOR
A
BASIC
PEDICURE
THEY
MAKE
UP
PRICES
This
is
the
most
expensive
pedicure
have
ever
gotten
Usually
its
only
about
25-$30
But
apparently
an
extra
20-$30
to
take
off
polish
Okay
there
do
yourself
a
favour
and
save
from
paying
DOUBLE
for
pedicure
will
not
be
back
Came
here
for
lunch
Environment
is
great
Great
choices
food
and
they
all
look
delicious
Will
be
coming
back
to
try
different
noodles
I
came
in
to
get
my
glasses
fixed
I'm
a
horrible
person
because
always
need
Sam
helps
me
And
he
is
so
wonderful
helping
me
each
and
every
time
When
you
A
pair
you're
downtown
Henderson
were
real
people
live
your
here
I
am
completely
useless
when
it
comes
to
all
the
paperwork
etc...needed
purchasing
a
house
but
Julie
and
her
team
made
so
easy
for
me
Their
attention
detail
market
knowledge
availability
me
I
was
very
needy

truly
amazing
Loved
working
with
them
would
never
consider
any
other
real
estate
agent
Amazing
happy
hour
great
atmosphere
delicious
food
and
wonderful
drinks
I
believe
the
only
thing
could
complain
about
is
fact
that
layout
was
a
little
uncomfortable
to
maneuver
around

after
couple
of
drinks
walking
in
high
heels
it
challenging
not
bump
into
people's
tables
chairs
while
trying
get
other
side
restaurant
After
suffering
the
mediocrity
of
Agave
terse
life
Dos
Caminos
and
overly
authentic
Toros
I
was
super
excited
to
dine
here
Unfortunately
won't
get
chance
Due
a
private
event
booking
whole
restaurant
on
Tuesday
after
work
Nothing
like
spending
millions
renovations
not
letting
locals
access
it
Thanks
Mercadito
we're
off
great
start
I
don't
know
why
anyone
would
eat
or
work
here
All
the
servers
look
high
My
wife
swore
she
saw
one
of
them
getting
high
in
bathroom...another
throwing
up
The
staff
screams
at
each
other
and
puts
down
front
guests..very
unprofessional
disrespectful
And
what's
with
owner
Steroids
maybe..save
your
money..eat
someplace
else
This
was
our
experience
at
Norm's
Diner
We
were
told
where
to
sit
we
not
seated
sat
with
out
menus
and
weren't
spoken
for
least
10
minutes
During
this
time
two
other
couples
came
in
given
When
the
waitress
did
come
table
she
us
would
have
wait
had
tables
before
us
Yea
people
that
after
A
different
brought
menus
such
a
small
place
menu
good
variety
She
explained
they
are
serving
breakfast
lunch
dinner
My
husband
went
restroom
that's
when
back
take
order
Who
does
you'd
think
waited
until
he
returned
Our
order
finally
taken
I
got
breakfast
burrito
which
according
consisted
of
eggs
beans
cheese
mine
these
ingredients
plus
ham
They
should
really
keep

on
various
reasons
meatloaf

I
have
to

my

None

Very

Also
icecream

Caught
a

I

no

Findlay
Service
said
to

they

They

And
did

The

Tastes

like
Staff
very

Prices
are
high
This
basically
a

restaurant
charging
high
end
prices
Plus
they
sneaky
Fried
pickels
4.95
on
the
menu
but
actually
charge
5.95
I
can't
recommend
this
place
because
of
go
to
Decatur
location
This
is
our
go
to
local
place
The
burgers
are
great
and
the
fact
that
they
only

each
on
Monday
nights
makes
them
even
better
fish

Sliders
aren't
my

these
were
good
Good

I
wish
had
gone
for
an

but
they
let
me
do
20

20
Not
bad
threw
some
axes
and
ninja
stars
They
also
in-depth
tutorial
session
with
plenty
of
practice
throws
And
offer
beers
water
to
buy
while
you
throw
It's
not
as
scary
or
dangerous
thought
the
weapons
are
dulled
down
efficient
enough
targets
Their
rules
ensure
safety
Will
come

I'm

this

Well
it's
more
than
a
month
since
I
had
the
tiny
beet
salad
at
Tarbells
In
addition
to
posting
it
on
Yelp
also
put
note
Tarbell
site
about
my
experience
No
response
all
from
them
certainly
wasn't
expecting
free
meal
but
would
have
been
nice
if
they
acknowledged
comment
Won't
ever
be
going
there
again
Thanks
to
our
fantastic
server
Whitney

She
was
fast
fun
and
helpful
The
food
great
the
chips
salsa
were
one
of
a
kind
We
live
in

and
took
the
30

to
try
The

it
carries
Here

Ok
I
had
the
Lobster
Pot
Pie
for
dinner...only
thing
left
on
plate
were
peas..but
it
was
creamy
lots
of
lobster
and
a
flaky
pie
crust..it
awesome
Most
definitely
vindictive
and
unprofessional
as
another
review
stated
especially
the
lying
management
team
Super
bad
energy
disrespectful
condescending
clearly
seen
in
their
comments
back
to
1star
reviews
They
act
like
cleaning
teams
prison-like
crews
do
an
amazing
job
but
it's
shoddy
for
sure
not
worth
money
It's
more
a
janitor
style
clean
There
are
constant
changes
crews
well
can't
blame
crew
I'd
quit
too
The
eco
supplies
they
use
super
harsh
I
was
told
reuse
scrubbers
sponges
from
house

yep
that
means
your
neighbors
germs
sh!t
getting
mixed
with
sh!t
Sooo
disgusting
If
you
ever
have
issue
be
assured
WILL
screw
over
experienced
it
multiple

Management

Best

I've

If

want
smooth
experience
then
come
here
Steiner's
serves
average
pub
food
but
with
a
good
selection
of
draft
beers
The
food
alone
would
probably
merit
two
stars
though
few
dishes
definitely
are
better
best
I've
eaten
at
is
their
meat
loaf
which
most
the
time
exceptional
served
mashed
potatoes
and
gravy
worst
had
buffalo
shrimp
little
more
than
overcooked
battered
medium-large
shrimp
shrimp
I
was
were
so
they
coiled

like

Of
course
that
made
them
almost
unfit
to

Their
chili
better
Winchell's

Was

I
told

again
Well

definitely
recommend
Dr
any

We
like
to
support
local
restaurants
and
were
excited
try
this
new
place
completely
underwhelmed
with
all
of
the
food
include
a
pizza
pasta
dish
an
appetizer
salad
The
food
was
not
awful
it
just
wasn't
special
or
something
what
professional
chef
might
make--I'm
stellar
cook
I
could
have
fixed
these
dishes
at
home
should
also
mention
those
items
plus
two
drinks
cost
63
for
lunch
including
tip
Our
waiter
while
nice
terrible
He
would
leave
return
10
15
minutes
brought
our
about
leave
we
had
point
out
needed
refills
on
drinks
silverware
did
know
supposed
be
in
my
salad
when
asked
track
him
down
get
bill
as
he
apparently
started
setting
up
tables
inside
I'm
sure
if
short-attention-span-theater
what
they
appeared
plenty
staff
only
few
occupied
tables
A
real

several
fronts
Alan
pierced
my
15
yr
Old's
belly
button
He
was
great
Explained
after
care
and
made
the
whole
experience
I
had
no
idea
this
was
such
a
hotspot
in
the
Cleve
area
We
tried
to
go
on
Sunday
night
but
it
too
crowded
A
two
hour
wait
is
not
possible
with
2
year
old
so
we
split
In
that
time
separate
employees
were
pretty
rude
people
waiting
Despite
made
trip
from
downtown
for
late
Monday
lunch
seated
quickly
and
got
our
drinks
good

It

Everything
just

I
would
certainly
recommend
consome
Everything
in
here
is
far
too
expensive
except
the
chocolate
bars
and
their
weekly/monthly
special
on

table
The
factory
second

are
over
10
what
little
they
have
of

you
can't
even

what's
a
total

Also

at
all

counter
friendly
O&B
is
always
great
which
why
I
decided
to
have
a
birthday
brunch
with
my
girlfriends
It
was
no
problem
accommodating
large
party
and
the
waiter
very
attentive
No
one
had
any
complaints
on
their
dishes
were
all
quite
yummy
drinks
good
too
Overall
we
great
time
The
only
thing
that
when
requested
separate
bills
got
some
attitude
would
been
better
just
tell
us
than
make
feel
bad
for
asking
In
end
they
did
it
but
begrudgingly
Nikki
was
great
She
professional
and
very
fast
I
would
highly
recommend
her
will
definitely
be
going
back
This
place
is
the
worst

third
and
last
time
here
I
managed
to
get
same
lousy
waitress
two
out
of
three
times
The
other
while
not
as
bad
was
still
far
from
good
came
here
because
like
eat
n
park
in
general
this
on
way
my
girls
school
hoping
that
just
caught
them
at
times
but
after
a
row
would
have
say
finding
good
hard
waitress
So
order
never
see
until
she
brings
daughters
food
No
food
for
me
yet
it's
too
make
an
omelette
apparently
This
is
my
new
favorite
brunch
place
It's
the
cutest
and
it's
so
aesthetically
pleasing
very
modern
simplistic
with
a
lot
of
little
plants

Got
to
sit
at
table
by
wall
plants
which
also
might
be

I'm

burritos
definitely
first
choice
but
breakfast

Ended
up

I
put

Buy
my
last
I
bought
the
chicken
kebab
plate
and
they
took
out
one
skewer
put
it
on
grill
told
me
would
take
like
12
minutes
So
was
thinking
1
minutes
Bleh

guess
that's
better
than
having
just
under
a
heat
lamp
or
something

Just
is

What
ripoff
But
when
got

realized
that
way

The
much
bigger
thought
was

there
That

for

I
checked
out
this
restaurant
with
a
few
girl
friends
while
shopping
in
Charlotte
The
traffic
was
horrible
we
were
starving
so
figured
would
try
it
This
reminds
me
lot
of
want-a-be
Disney
restaurant
They
tried
very
hard
the
decor
but
most
it
came
off
little
tacky
and
childish
cleanliness
seemed

BEWARE

Met
some
friends
from
work
for
a
Happy
Hour
here
last
week
The
venue
is
wide
open
with
plenty
of
space
interesting
decor
racy
vintage
photos
and
posters
TVs
games
Although
we
sat
at
table
there
was
no
waitress
to
help
us
so
had
keep
going
the
bar
order
beer
food
Can't

this

A-OK
an
after

I'm
not

I'd
feel
comfortable
coming
just
food/service
My
boyfriend
and
I
grew
up
with
Mexican
food
we
love
this
place
The
Frijoles

SO
GOOD
the

We
glad
to

it
stays
around
for
a

My
experience
was
so
great

I
had
to
leave
a
Yelp
review
recently
visiting
family
in
Madison
when
disaster
struck
car
dead...my
sister-in-law
needed
quick
high-quality
reliable

Our

guy
Scott
A
first

What
really
made
A
stand
out
from
other
guys
we
dealt
with
at

time
he
spent

what
my
S-i-L

perfect
fit
They
selection
quality

sister
said
it
felt
more
like

sounded
funny
analogy
but
very
true
Cheer

team
don't
hesitate
recommend
them
anyone
that

Good
place
to
eat
when
you're
drunk
but
I
have
had

in

they
locations
and
the

are
so
so
Not
a
big
fan
be
honest

the
price
on
a
double

dish
It
is
laughable
Three

I
have

on

Two
fantastic

It

Moving

I've

here
half

times
never

I'm

To
summarize
I
have
to
agree
with
the
person
who
wrote
first
review
saw
their
ads
a
few
months
ago
and
was
very
excited
My
husband
gave
it
try
two
days
ago
say
that
I'm
disappointed
about
food
they
offered
First
what
you
may
want
know
came
from
Sichuan
China
where
Chinese
style
spicy
hot
pot
originated
from
What
this
restaurant's
supposed
offer
tang
is
basically
fast
version
of
pot
ordered
they'd
cook
for
you
The
most
important
factors
good
tang
are
1
plenty
choices
can
choose
2
has
be
fresh
cooked
just
right
so
remains
crunchy
Unfortunately
restaurant
actually
offers
none
Their
frozen
easily
find
at
Chinese/Korean
grocery
store
They
don't
offer
potato
slices
seaweed
or
sweet
noodles
which
considered
must-haves
in
tangs
not
hard
found
Asian
stores
lotus
root
slices
ones
taste
horrible
even
bother
buy
roots
cut
them
by
themselves
honest
think
everyone
exact
themselves
using
ingredient
stores
need
spend
15
place
would
suggest
owner
more
serious
opening
business
At
least
prepare
super
market
Also
sure
whether
aware
this
but
ingredients
brought
contains
pork
cow
fat
I'd
clearly
mark
vegetarians
people
religious
beliefs
won't
accidentally
ate
it
I
really
enjoyed
this
movie
Theater
and
would
defiantly
recommend
for
Couples
if
you
have
kids
keep
them
at
home
lol
This
will
be
Me

after

best
dinner...and
since
we
were
back
in

Paris
decided
to
stop
by
here
The
cashier
lady
was
very
nice
and
kind
but
seemed
have
a
bit
of
trouble
register
think
maybe
something
broken
so
it
took
while
for
us
just
get
order
ordered
Napoleon

WOW

a
dozen
times

that
was
just

The
most
perfectly
prepared
sweet

piece
of

Everything
simply
perfection

Thank

Imagine
another
negative
review
for
this
location
The
Curly
fries
were
cold
diet
coke
was
flat
and
the
ad
I
am
subjected
to
50
times
a
day
not
honored
at
Companies
should
hire
someone
read
reviews
address
issues
Needless
say
my
poor
GF
didn't
want
get
forced
in
2
combo
meals
so
she
opted
just
an
order
of
fries
Well
it
unfair
when
realized
did
one
threw
mine
trash
will
never
know
if
they
are
any
good
because
go
back
Now
we
going
drive
over
Gyro
Time
on
Charleston
where
what
is
advertised
fair
price
Delicious
fresh
and
very
friendly
unpretentious
The
only
issue
we
had
was
the
toro
a
little
frozen
Everything
is
presented
beautifully
I
would
give
STK
in
Vegas
5
stars
but
they
have
the
worst
customer
service
so
2stars
for
them
Blonde
chick
that
checked
our
RSVP
was
a
snob
Really
bitch
get
real
job
Make
sure
to
entire
party
present
otherwise
last
person
arrive
won't
be
able
order
her
food
and
will
just
share
with
others
The
waiter
rushed
us
asked
are
you
done
now
Didn't
ask
if
we
wanted
take
any
go
grabbed
plates
while
one
of
my
friend
still
eating
So
took
time
eat
desserts
left

I've

3
or
4
times
and
generally
haven't
had
too
many
issues
other
than
slow
service
which
is
an
issue
I
find
common
at
most
BP's
This
time
decided
try
their
online

placed
my

received

The
promised

came
went
Half
hour
later
finally
check
on
the
they
never
it
was
given
some
story
that
sometimes
orders
sent
wrong
stores
when
ordered
online
If
a
consistent
problem
then
don't
accept
orders
better
yet
hire
service
do
it
for
you
They
said

I'm
VERY

We
went
to
Tamarind
for
my
husband's
birthday
as
we
both
were
craving
good
Indian
food
Well
I
have
say
that
it's
a
hidden
gem
in
the
NW
corner
of
city
The
décor
is
nice
and
modern
will
surely
come
under

prices
are
not

bad

So

What
a
pity
that
the
words
pasty
and
tasty
don't
exactly
rhyme
despite
spellings
fact
Cornish
is
so
fkn
tasty
The
word
pasty
in
context
of
pasty
rhymes
with
U.S
pronunciation
nasty
how
perverse
that
Traditional
or
non-traditional
authentic
otherwise
I
have
enjoyed
every
one

I've
tried

My
favorite
among

it
even
possible

not
what

are

they
rather

really
felt

it

that
we
enjoyed
our

tonight
Every

I
have
never
had
a
bad
experience
at
Red
until
last
night
My
birthday
dinner
with
family
Soon
as
our
party
sat
down
my
sister
got
splinter
deep
in
her
hand
from
the
chairs
which
clearly
were
so
worn
and
cracked
We
asked
for
tweezers
they
found
us
The
server
was
really
awesome
But
manager
on
two
occasions
addressed
few
things
getting
splinter
Then
everyone's
food
came
out
steaks
charred
dry
you
couldn't
cut
that's
not
medium

Gross

worst
I've
ever
had
So
dry
believe
how
awful
everything
was
brought
this
to
attention
of
same
who
an
attitude
he
could
care
less
We've
been
both
locations
just
any
location
They
seemed
be
more
concerned
about
many
people
than
quality
service
And
best
part
nothing
comped
sisters
we
get
out
Most
sent
their
back
didn't
eat
Would
expect
such
failure
This
is
awful
fav
place
it
all
wrong
Won't
anytime
soon
I
would
have
rated
this
place
a
five
but
today
finally
realized
they
are
closed
for
good
No
word
to
no
one
signs
been
going
here

thought
did
pretty
good

the

And

owner
went

sent
him
an

will
be
surprised
he
responds
I
love
Yelp
Thanks
to
the
reviews
of
my
fellow
Yelpers
now
have
a
mechanic
for
our
family's
three
cars
was
willing
drive
little
further
due
consistently
good
reviews
and
am
glad
did
They
charged
price
oil
change
without
surprise
additional
disposal
fees
tire
rotation
that
requested
said
overall
inspection
and
specifically
asked
them
also
look
at
brakes
would
be
part
service
not
an
charge
When
they
were
done
called
told
me
brakes
looked
great
but
had
tires
recommended
we
get
new
going
Discount
Tires
which
is
where
already
go
He
therefore
did
recommend
doing
since
changing
anyway
appreciated
The
only
thing
found
engine
filter
dirty
out
nominal
fee
confirm
with
husband
he
fine
charging
just
part
so
whether
it
or
if
preferred
do
it
it'd
pretty
much
same
Haha
My
does
prefer
it
Me
neither
I'm
always
reassured
when
recommends
against
repairs
doesn't
charge
open
hood
take
around
Cars
cost
enough
without
paying
someone
looking
And
topped
off
fluids
didn't
us
either
So
I'll
bringing
cars
this
trust
repair
will
because
needed
That's
how
should
be
Came
here
after
reading
great
reviews
and
was
a
little
nervous
about
eating
crab
because
you
do
get
only
3
legs
Sooo
I
decided
to
give
it
shot
The
food
AMAZING
legs
were
big
wasn't
disappointed
It
reminded
me
Joe's
Crab
Shack
but
with
way
better
quality
highly
recommend
stopping
by
for
some
seafood
We
also
had
shrimp
delicious
as
well
is
bit
pricey
worth
it
Hope
enjoy
too
Pamela's
has
been
my
favorite
brunch
place
in
Pittsburgh
since
I
moved
here
seven
years
ago
don't
have
a
location
They're
all
great
and
the
same
menu
Huge
portions
always
leftovers
to
take
home
for
next
meal
Typical
American
style
steakhouse
comparable
to
a
slightly
nicer
Outback
Steakhouse
Food
took
quite
while
come
out
but
the
drinks
were
quick
The
ambiance
is
some
mix
between
nightclub
and
restaurant
portions
adequate
somewhat
repetitive
as
same
aspects
appear
in
many
dishes
The
beginning
books
and
courses
here
are
so
powerful
in
helping
me
to
elevate
my
game
plan
life
staff
super
friendly
their
services
address
every
major
challenge
They
open
people
of
all
faiths
offer
programs
help
anyone
overcome
any
life
or
business
It
has
been
over
two
years
of
continuous
service
and
Justin
still
impresses
me
He
coming
every
week
except
for
a
3
month
break
in
the
winter
as
I
do
not
have
rye
grass
replaced
2
different
sprinkler
heads
his
mower
broke
these
without
charge
takes
responsibility
work
works
quickly
is
always
friendly
efficient
goes
the
extra
mile
am
shocked
by
one-star
reviews
they
don't
appear
to
be
anything
like
my
experience
would
recommend
him
reservation

I
love
this
place
had
my
first
hot
yoga
experience
well
actually
it
was
time
doing
any
sort
of
yoga
here
about
a
year
ago
little
worried
that
wouldn't
be
able
to
handle
the
heat
but
staff
very
happy
answer
all
questions
and
made
me
feel
lot
less
nervous
prior
class
relieved
not
everyone
in
class
pro
People
were
different
levels
definitely
felt
as
though
we
just
there
enjoy
make
most
it
There
wasn't
judgement
for
those
us
who
starting
out
During
they
come
around
help
you
if
you're
quite
correct
positions
You
can
tell
them
beforehand
you'd
prefer
leave
be
found
helpful
My
positive
have
returned
studio
and
also
their
location
at
Yonge
Sheppard
several
times
would
highly
recommend
beginners
They
classes
on
Friday
evenings
Sunday
afternoons
are
cheaper
However
keep
mind
these
fill
up
quickly
so
get
early
Seriously
one
of
the
most
wonderful
beauty
experiences
I
have
ever
had
in
Toronto
My
natural
light
brown
lashes
needed
some
serious
love
and
Stephanie
designed
a
flirty
look
am
crazy
about
them
Her
Expertise
Nursing

nature
made
experience
so
comfortable

nice
flavor
spicy
Service
great
can't
wait
back
This
is
my
fave
place
for
savoury
pies
They
also
have
a
tasty
selection
of
sweet
pies
The
seasonal
pies
are
always
interesting
flavour
combinations
and
the
regular
menu
super
too
Inevitably
I
walk
out
with
box
frozen

so
convenient
that
can
bake
them
at
home
when
need
quick
easy
meal
whenever
stop
by
freshly
baked
pie
coleslaw
must-have
side
me
because
it's
right
amount
crunch
creaminess
plus
it
accompanies
wonderfully
perfect
seats
just
cant
get
any
better
Forget
the
food
concession
They
are
expensive
and
have
one
speed.....reverse
the
food
was
stunningly
boring
over
salted
cooked
and
just
plain
mediocre
I
felt
like
should
have
been
eating
at
an
Olive
Garden
in
Arkansas
server
never
asked
why
our
mostly
untouched
do
not
plan
on
spending
time
money
or
energy
this
restaurant
again
We
just
had
a
Gamez
on
Wheelz
truck
come
to
our
house
for
son's
11th
birthday
party
and
man
what
hit
Those
kids
were
so
excited
because
of
this
truck
And
once
the
arrived
was
set
up
in
whole
time
an
absolute
blast
They
loved
up
truck
game
selection
GREAT
time
Even
some
older
who
normally
are
too
cool
participate
activities
playing
games
Josh
Tanner
awesome
answered
my
questions
booked
there
no
issues
at
all
lucky
guy
bring
help
out
with
games
inside
truck
He
very
patient
helped
them
whatever
they
needed
The
blast
we
really
appreciated
easy
party
I
would
recommend
sure
I
gave
them
a
chance
before
had
to
write
about
how
incredibly
bad
this
company
is
Had
it
not
ended
way
would
been
leaving
feedback
Initially
the
guy
who
first
came
seemed
really
nice
except
that
pay

for
him
look
at
my
refrigerator
10
minutes
IN
CASH
This
only

were
small
black

all
over
the

myself
somewhere
else
but
told
two

They
said
oh

During

Amazing

gladly
return
future
when

nicest
I've
seen
living
here
I
cant
say
enough
good
things
about
this
place
Unfortunately
forgot
my
tattoo
artist
name
but
he
was
great
came
from
out
of
town
for
cousins
funeral
and
she
had
a
big
love
sunflowers
so
few
us
in
the
family
got
tattoos
her
memory
Thank
you
taking
your
time
fitting
all
being
kind
during
what
very
emotional
day
It
was
a
last
minute
decision
to
get
tattoo
while
we
were
in
Vegas
We
researched
nearby
shops
on
Yelp
and
this
place
had
the
best
reviews
greeted
by
someone
forgot
his
name
but
he
super
nice
said
that
Russ
would
be
doing
our
tattoos
I
already
an
image
with
me
worked
me
change
font
bit
created
my
beautiful
little
tattoo
He
so
pleasant
work
with
great
personality
loves
talk
has
very
light
hand
all
years
of
getting
tattoos
first
did
not
bleed
or
hurt
immensely
afterward
can't
say
enough
good
things
about
shop
Russ
The
is
clean
music

when
you
are

It

my
first

our
bartender
Joshua
took
great
care
of
us
I
love
beer
drilled
him
on
all
the
types
beers
that
like
what
he
thinks
would
like
He
to
describe
each
one
then
gave
me
a
sampler
Which
sipped
on
My
favorite
Booty
But
who
doesn't
Booty..haha

soon
WORST
SERVICE
EVER
It's
my
birthday
We
took
a
late
night
flight
into
Vegas
and
now
I'm
here
after
1am
waiting
in
long
long
line
of
people
for
rental
car
There
is
1
sometimes
2
persons
serving
us
But
it's
been
30
minutes
almost
halfway
through
the
line
Happy
Birthday
to
me
Second
time
going
there
and
it
did
not
disappoint
at
all
First
was

Went

my
wife

outstanding
Highly
highly
recommend
Really
cute
boba
place
I
love
the
atmosphere
and
unique
decorations
The
staff
was
also
really
friendly
And
they
have
punch
cards
Will
be
dropping
by
more
often
since
it's
close
by
Not
surprised
by
this
place's
rating
because
it
is
a
really
great
spot
I
had
never
heard
of
but
that's
only
I'm
not
from
around
here
For
travelers
it's
convenient
spot
close
to
the
airport
and
alternative
hotel
lounges
Great
food
cozy
environment
plus
beer
It's
a
hospital
and
that's
it
You
check
in
with
ghetto
shafawnda
then
you
sit
watch
your
80
year
old
mother
terrible
pain
as
they
shoot
the
shit
Because
this
neighborhood
is
crack
heads
assume
are
one
well
Las
Vegas
scum
of
earth
for
Healthcare
There
is
one
lady
I
especially
go
to
all
the
time
if
am
getting
my
haircut
and
she
usually
does
a
great
job
She
knows
how
want
hair
done
its
cut
pretty
quickly
Sometimes
you
may
call
ahead
because
wait
at
this
can
be
10-15min
I've
been
here
a
couple
of
times
and
they
have
always
extremely
busy
which
has
related
to
slow
service
Overall
it's
great
bar
They
ton
beers
on
draught
select
wines
pretty
good
drink
menu
Most
their
cocktails
are
5-$7
is
bonus
in
my
book
Plus
seem
specials
The
food
isn't
bad
either
I
came
for
lunch
got
the
chicken
wrap
was
ok
Nothing
spectacular
also
had
wings
were
winner
me
I'll
definitely
be
back
those
wings
only
50cents
wish
knew
when
run
specials

My
review
is
for
our
Togo
experience
We
are
used
to
4
egg
rolls
at
pho
places
so
we're
surprised
there
only
2
per
order
The
portions
small
though
the
meat
fresh
Noodle
usually
heaping
other
places
Maybe
2/3
cup
here
No
hoison
or
Sriracha
in
bag
not
even
utensils
Won't
be
back
Sorry
I'm
not
a
huge
fan
of
ice
cream
but
I
loved
this
place
There
are
ton
options
from
the
base
to
add-ins
and
toppings
We
had
let
person
behind
go
before
us
since
we
were
worried
taking
too
long
make
decision
ended
up
going
for
signature
with
captn
crunch
mixed
in
on
top
it
With
them
making
it
right
there
front
you
cereal
doesn't
have
chance
get
soggy
so
gives
nice
as
eating
it
Next
time
will
pass
adding
top
well
wasn't
necessary
My
friend
vanilla
bean
chocolate

added
in
Service
was
fast
friendly
The
store
bright
comfortable
It
took
about
5
minutes
our
cream
two
smalls
cost
around
15.00
I
have
taken
my
fur
baby
here
for
shave
and
bath
love
the
employees
they
seem
so
good
to
Joe
The
cost
is
up
there
but
never
been
disappointed

done
the
food
here
is
delicious
and
cheap
for
a
buffet
unfortunately
i
had
to
take
off
one
star
star
taken
because
of
dining
arrangement
in
restaurant
it
very
difficult
get
seat
there
on
busy
day
it's
such
small
space
also
if
you
are
with
large
group
might
have
end
up
sitting
at
separate
tables
or
trying
cram
about
6
people
table

buffet
where
kare
is
so
even
though
its

that
sucks
i'll

I
spent
three
days
looking
for
a
place
my
sister
found
myself
frustrated
because
AHCCS
does
not
offer
lot
of
options
and
most
the
places
covered
are
less
than
satisfactory
called
Megan
at
Friendship
right
away
knew
this
was
professional
caring
The
only
thing
can
say
is
go
in
take
tour
talk
to
staff
you'll
leave
optimistic
about
treatment
facility
clean
inviting
If
you
in
process
stop
here
Go
Now
No
NOW
This
place
is
hands
down
the
best
of
its
kind
I
have
never
had

I
got
the
Maine
Lobster

Overall
it
wasn't
a
bad
roll
yet
understand
why
was
priced
around
20
It
comes
with
cole
slaw
and
some
fried
chips
Only
con
seating
Other
than
that
it's
worth
good
bite
I
love
this
place
The
menue
is
limited
though
they
are
always
happy
to
make
substitutions

You

yummy
By

the
best
Carbonara
I
have
ever
had
didn't
know
what
to
expect
when
stopped

for
lunch
but
white

on
table
weren't
part
of
vision
ordered
Spaghetti

next
move
Love
this
place
Loved
especially
seeing
an
entire
side
of
a
menu
dedicated
to
various
MUSSEL
dishes
There
must
have
been
dozen
different
options
mostly
priced
at
16
The
bowl
is
huge
I
would
guess
3
mussels
tried
the

so
expecting
great
quality
that
late
probably
our
fault
My
group
of
4
heavy
the
crab
legs
tacos
tried
bunch
other
things
The
were
standout
in
opinion
especially
Pork
Al
Pastor
ones
must
have
eaten
at
least
6
It
cool
they
had
all
different
pepper
sauces
to
accompany
tacos
fine
although
melted
butter
nowhere
be
found
rest
food
mediocre
It's
nice
500
items
but
I'd
rather
100
do
them
well
Food
8/10

Authentic
Chinese
food
Tasty
Cleanliness
5/10
Could
be
better
Ambiance
3/10
The
place
is
super
tiny
and
worn
out
Need's
an
overhaul
Restrooms
Didn't
visit
Service
7/10
Friendly
friendly
but
rushed
because
there
a
wait
Because
the
restaurant
small's
weight
can
long
My
first
couple
spray
tans
were
good
here
so
I
gave
them
an
excellent
review
Had
a
bad
experience
and
have
stopped
going
since
was
unable
to
get
resolution
from
salon
Well
I'm
sick
Walked
out
of
the
restaurant
10
minutes
ago
after
eating
maybe
one
eighth
my
Ham
Benedict
III
and
I
am
physically
And
that's
literally
not
even
only
bad
part
experience
that
taking
a
break
from
puking
right
now
to
write
about
want
make
clear
coffee
is
decent
though
love
good
iced
mocha
here
barista
doing
job
in
midst
landfill
So
waiter
walked
up
us
just
stood
there
smiled
until
at
table
said
Hey

it
going
One
creepiest
waiters
ever
then
he
Do
you
hear
about
our
pancake
we
replied
with
Sure
guy
did
know
what
was
pancake
Food
comes
nothing
better
happens
My
plate
smelled
like
body
odor
don't
if
it's
hollandaise
or
what
but
repulsive
Then
see
forever
when
back
no
has
eaten
anything
some
hash
browns
says
guys
need
box
Our
cards
are
already
on
table
come

here
before
actually
puke
floor
have
had
experiences
with
under
cooked
eggs
weird
servers
who
sit
down
next
take
your
order
so
close
home
school
keep
finding
myself
going
convenience
never
again
being
sick
for
food
appetizing
Bottom
line
is
good
service
trash
almost
always
ridiculous
wait
which
still
perplexes
me
would
recommend
this
place
any

times
and
just
ordered

Every

Hotel

clean
located
near
the
few

that
are
in
cleveland...take
a
short
walk
its
easy
to
get
around.The
room
service
isnt
cheap
but
food
good
comes
up
quickly
The
rooms
itself
modern
huge
We
came
on
weekend
December
they
were
reasonably
priced
Also
theres
valet
parking..which
seemed
at
first
upon
checking
out
there
was
bit
of
wait
confusion
I
would
give
hotel
5
stars
we
received
two
seperate
charges
for
100
each
which
not
notified
about
so
make
sure
check
your
bill
verify
everything
first
This
place
is
like
being
transported
to
the
streets
of
Miami
While
seating
super
small
with
only
four
tables
menu
delightful
They
specialize
in
Mofongo
but
have
many
other
choices
for
any
Latin
lover
We
had
loaded
plantain
chips
and
roasted
pork
Mofongo
Ask
homemade
hot
sauce
not
really
spicy
differently
good
w
fresh
mint

Ah
So
gooooood
5
stars
sure
By
mistake
the
taxi
driver
took
us
there
for
pizza
The
server
was
very
help
full
friendly

We
ordered
three
different
pizza
veggie
spinach
arugula
with
bruschetta
All
of
them
great
crust

taste
Love
bread
they
serve
bear
recommend.we
all
are
happy
to
find
this
place
Cute
chinese
pancake
vendor
outside
delicious
looking
americanized
pastries
at
the
bakery
a
quick
fast
food
section
like
other
ranch

but
asian
and
great

good
prices
No
indian
Asiana
market
I
am
definitely
fan...now
to
learn
Chinese
so
can
understand
labels
For
an
iconic
property
it
sad
to
see
and
now
say
the
Flamingo
is
not
capitalizing
on
its
storied
history
The
property
in
desperate
need
of
a
bath
overhaul
It
should
be
restored
heyday

Would
love
Teri

if
if

Our

Meeting
with

The
service

attentive
but
not

contributing
an
overall

food
was
good
however
as
you
may
see
from

shrimp

bit
lacking

bun

looked

Therefore

This
night
out
with
good
friends
became
an
amazing
experience
thanks
to
our
waiter
Ryan
a
great
support
staff
and
someone
who
worked
magic
in
the
kitchen
We
asked
Ryan
for
suggestions
he
selected
most
food
drinks
we've
ever
experienced
Wasn't
cheap
but
we
will
never
forget
THANK
YOU
RYAN
being
amazing
Worst
place
ever

the
food
it's
testing
only
fine
but
there
is
no
for
a
buffet
all
empty
and
they
don't
refill
it
when
you
ask
said
coming
ofcurse
nothing
coming
We
asked
water
we
are
getting
warm
ice
my
husband
and
me
both
kinda
like
vietnamese
food
so
we
went
to
visit
this
place
while
were
at
scarborough
It
was
decent
food
interiors
neat
simple
And
most
of
their
dishes
are
around
8
10
I
in
for
a
stir
fried
egg
noodle
ordered
pho
with
pork
which
he
said
delicious.Well
i
thought
will
have
chunks

noodles
some
sauce
or
whatever
it
quite
different
from
what
thought
believe
the
itself
made
egg(which
meaning
behind
menu
card

topped
veggies
when
served
not
bad
either

The
poutine
here
is
aaaaaaaAMAZINGGGGG
I
came
on
a
Friday
and
it
seemed
very
busy
most
of
the
tables
were
full
Despite
that
was
served
fairly
quick
waitress
super
nice
Just
thinking
about
this
place
makes
my
taste
buds
water
will
definitely
be
coming
back
for
more

The
photo
says
it
all
Everyone
knows
the
stereotype
about
car
mechanics
being
scam
artists
Most
of
time
that's
not
much
a
stretch

who
hasn't
been
scammed
by
mechanic
at
one
point
or
another
My
uncle
recommended
this
shop
few
years
back
and
now
I
refuse
to
take
my
anywhere
but
John

How
many
times
have
you
overheard
excited
saving
his
customers
almost
2k
Nuff
said
They
nicest

will
always
tell
how
is
If
you're
looking
for

look
no
further
Period
I've
become
a
regular
their
biryani
though
different
from

one
I
used
to
have
in
Karachi
tastes
great
Always
made
exactly
as
expect

great
taste
and
customer
service
is
excellent
The
workers
are
very
friendly
and
service
is
fast
Homemade
soup
nicely
presented
tastes
great
Cesar

was
fresh
but
wish
I
would
have
gotten
the

Best

I
love

If
you
start
your
day
here
promise
won't
regret
it
First
time
there
Decor
Foyer
is
halfway
decent
Inside
looks
like
a
cafeteria
Tables
tightly
packed
together
like
two
feet
between
tables
Noisy
I've
never
seen
Japanese
restaurant
with
such
cheap
decor
Lots
of
people
though
Entire
was
filled
Service
waiters
Half
them
can't
see
your
hand
raised
because
the
wood
dividers
separating
tables
blocks
their
vision
Orders
got
forgotten
Ordered
soft-shell
crab
They
didn't
have
it
neglected
to
tell
me
just
brought
I
had
follow
up
On
upside

waiters
seem
speak
fluent
English
Food
fancy

White

All
could
taste
spices
on
tuna
Sashimi
sliced
inconsistently
some
were
extremely
thin
and
some
fairly
thick
Yuzu-miso
sauce
tomato
apparently
same
The
deep
fried

no

Rolls

old

is
Mango
panna
cotta
mango
yogurt
same
except
served
pretty
glass
fruit
topped
whipped
cream
chocolate
sauce
In
my
opinion
more
worth
More
mango
Less
filler
Their
baked
mussel
good
Think
alfredo
cheese
avocado
sashimi
which
much
means
avocado
best
thing
sesame
pudding
It's
not
very
sweet
has
enough
unbelievably
creamy
For
price
I'd
say
this
one-time
thing
As
as
appreciated
pudding
better
elsewhere
With
so
many
chain
and
industry
manufactured
pizzas
out
there

this
is
awesome
home
style
pizza

If
you
want
a
great
won't
be
disappointed
I
was
so
incredibly
blessed
to
have
brought
my
dog
here
can
home
in
a
really
bad
rash
she
had
lost
all
the
hair
on
back
of
her
legs
and
ears
vaccinate
due
policy
at
apartment
My
dog
when
given
vaccine
over
month
or
gets
secondary
skin
infections
even
went
with
holistic
it
still
caused
same
issues
It's
frustrating
worrisome
this
happens
but
able
take
Green
Valley
they
got
us
right
away
They
were
super
gentle
pooch
helped
me
get
better
path
also
feed
raw
I'm
thankful
didn't
talk
out
tell
bad
know
what's
best
for
never
questioned
judgement
This
makes
feel
more
comfortable
taking
The
place
is
walk-in
unless
your
boarding
need
an
overnight
stay
are
open
till
7pm
which
great
me
Yum
Staff
was
friendly
and
the
food
amazing
This
place
is
so
busy
Can't
wait
to
come
back

again
I
had
green

some
pineapple

also
tried

It
closes
pretty
late
it
has
seats
indoor
The
cashier
is
friendly
You
can
get

Beautiful
but
expensive
If
I
ever
win
multiple
millions
on
the
lottery
may
be
able
to
afford
shopping
there
it
is
absolutely
gorgeous
simply
window
shop
in
So
high
end
shops
gathered
all
in
one
spot
and
along
a
hugely
long
hallway
that
as
opulent
would
require
This
fantasy
destination
This
is
a
great
cheap
place
to
eat
and
drink
in
this
area
Nothing
fancy
but
very
kind/fast
service
They
had
specials
on
Saturday
night
The
kitchen
open
super
late
Easy
walking
distance
from
the
Hampton
Inn
Suites
or
Marriott
The
best
lamb
in
Charlotte
Everything
was
so
flavorful
and
delicious
go
here
do
your
tastebuds
a
favor
lol
Food
and
service
are
great
Just
be
careful
not
order
too
much
stuffs
their
Cajun
size
is
crazy
huge
I
really
wanted
to
like
this
place
but
guess
A-OK
will
suffice
was
just
going
get
a
French
onion
soup
and
dessert
as
had
eaten
elsewhere
prior
The
overly
animated
waiter
suggested
special
potato
gnocchi
dish
jumped
on
it
it
my
mistake
go
for
an
Italian
classic
in
restaurant
so
I'll
share
some
of
the
blame
All
components
were
things
liked
who
doesn't
black
truffles
they
didn't
seem
jive
dishes
I'm
used
to
cheesy
cream
sauce
compliment
good
neither
harmonious
creamy
nor
gnocchi
texture
wasn't
chewy
fell
apart
too
easy...the
crispy
shoestring
onions
topped
greens
also
meld
Aside
from
not
being
super
satisfied
given
bread
until
very
end
meal
eat
meal
reverse
This
is
cool
spot
dine
especially
if
you
are
fortunate
grab
outside
table
nice
evening
I've
much
better
food
most
likely
come
back
give
them
another
shot
at
point
reviews
mostly
solid
If
i
could
give
0
stars
would
the
worst
place
to
ever
visit
in
all
of
canada
is
royal
fine

Smelll
Like
Marijuana
odor
Employee
nammed
Omar
and
Marwan
both

right
outside
their

how
DISGUSTING
IS
THat
I
went
there
get
car
left
smelling
LIke
MARIJUANA
WILL
NEVER
GO
BACK
THERE
THEY
SHOULD
BE
SUED
Why
is
everyone
so
damn
cheap
I
just
cant
get
over
it
Every
review
read
ppl
are
complaining
about
the
price
Its
like
expect
to
pay
10
for
a
4
course
5
star
dinner
am
not
super
cheap
but
also
frivolous
either
have
realistic
view
of
world
living
expensive
people
make
living
My
experience
far
in
life
that
most
very
entitled
entitled
world
and
work/pay
Now
sure
some
offended
by
this
their
mentality

dont
mind
paying
as
long
what
for
Ok
fair
enough
But
let
me
ask
you
this
What
reasonable
price
an
entree
at
restaurant
or
better
yet
visit
aquarium
Given
fact
aquarium
has
take
care
all
animals
staff
profit
stay
business...I
would
say
15
more
than
reasonable
So
3
difference
Now
really
worth
writing
getting
worked
up
about
Does
any
less
beautiful
fun
and/or
your
kids
NO
Lets
they
only
charged
were
taken
properly
was
making
minimum

which
cannot
support

Is
saving

that
try
buy

reason...spend

cents
bring

country
people
I
went
there
on
a
Saturday
afternoon
by
myself
and
wanted
to
sit
out
front
The
host
made
fun
of
me
Said
aw
that's
too
bad
when
said
it
was
just
me
No
is
perfectly
fine
in
my
book
got
the
lobster
roll
plenty
garlic
bread
roll
It
ok
most
annoying
part
kept
coming
talk
really
chill
myself
not
get

creepy
host
Got
a
direct
message
from
Shilpi
S
who
works
for
EOS
After
explaining
my
issues
they
were
able
to
help
me
substantially
Very
impressed
that
actually
took
concerns
and
helped

definitely
thankful
grateful
their
help
I
get
better
service
almost
anywhere
for
shoes
not
to
mention
prices
and
larger
selection
My
husband
bought
footwear
my
toddler
it
didn't
fit
We
were
well
past
the
return
time
on
receipt
when
we
finally
got
around
bringing
back
brand
new
in
box
never
worn
The
employee
who
may
have
been
a
manager
emphasized
how
long
policy
coming
in
stated
that
he
wouldn't
give
us
any
more
than
12
bucks
as
store
credit
we
paid
30
socks
with
will
NEVER
be
back
It
hurts
treat
customer
respect
courtesy
by
making
an
exception
That's
you
keep
customers
instead
of
losing
them
forever
Good
riddance

I
live

area
so
I'm
always
excited
when
new
businesses
come
around
also
love

Threadbare
does
not
disappoint
that
department
They
do
it
very
well
have
a
great

The

that
their

worse
than

for
the

gawd-awful

think
this

just
wants
be
a
dive
bar
with
cheap

and
it's
not
cheap
There
was
a
story
on

about
this
place
mixing
horse

meat
with
the

I've
been
going
to
this
location
for
two
years
now
My
doctors
are
amazing
I'm
always
greeted
with
a

when
I
walk
in
able
get
through
someone
call
immediate
Dr

Although
may
have
chronic
back
pain
knowing
an
amazing

at
Innovative

taking

me
helps
It's
hard
find
good
healthcare
in
So
Nevada
but
will
found
the
best
would
recommend
everyone
that
needs
management
I
don't
say
this
lightly

love
barbeque
mean
really
it
Texas

sauced
you
name

When

get
barbeque
wherever
possibly
can
have
been
known
to
reroute
my
connecting
flight
in
order
some
wonderful
eaten
it
everywhere
and
I'm
here
tell
that
these
guys
weird
unlikely
location
are
making
pretty
decent
BBQ
tried
three
items
Beef
brisket
is
favorite
so
went
for
first
It
was
thinly
sliced
juicy
delicious
had
a
nice
smoked
flavor
Smoking
of
course
the
key
any
good
These
smoke
their
own
meat
right
at
place
can
immediately
will
prefer
be
sliced
thicker
about
1/4
thick
with
fat
Slicing
thin
out
also
pulled
pork
A
thing
beauty
Wonderfully
tender
little
areas
char
smoke
Lastly
cut
I've
never
heard
of
they
call
pork
but
pectoral
muscle
pig
has
similar
grain
texture
beef
brisket
uniquely
delicious
it's
spice
on
meat
That's
not
all
most
amazing
selection
sauces
ever
tried
There
were
no
less
than
ten
options
all
which
try
way
in
Each
one
us
amazed
regional
classics
like
City
Carolina
mustard
very
unique
balsamic
onion
or
Scorched
berry
difficult
decide
we
got
four
different
ones
By
way
sauce
should
ON
something
apply
yourself
Service
friendly
Highly
recommended
Excellent
experience
at

Bought
some
pavers
during

Fall
sale
for
a
great
price
Service
was

and
the

offers
an
easy
place
to
load
up
head
out
I'd
go
back
other
landscape
needs
I
was
very
impressed
with
the
restaurant
Our
waiter
Charles
above
expectations
in
service
made
suggestions
on
what
to
order

hit
it
out

for
meal
We
found
that
we
were
served
timely
restaurant
clean

However

sizes
prices
just
can't
be
beat
place
isn't
fancy
but
certainly
a
local
favorite
If
you
aren't
too
cool
to
enjoy
great

seriously
rocks
It
is
difficult
to
come
by
great
food
in
Fort
Mill
South
Carolina
which
why
I'm
such
a
fan
of
Jumpin
Java/Bistro
160
Tucked
strip
mall
among
Burger
King
and
Papa
John's
Java
jewel
the
Mill
culinary
crown
Or
maybe
it
just
tiara
because
there
aren't
enough
decent
restaurants
justify
But
I
digress
I've
had
breakfast
business
meetings
coffee
breaks
lunch
with
girls
meals
my
family
which
includes
two
small
children
over
past
seven
years
never
been
disappointed
Among
favorites
menu
offerings
are
Warm
Goat
Cheese
Salad
Turkey
Apple
Cheddar
Wrap
The
pasta
salad
unique
side
croissants
freshest
have
found
area
Years
ago
they
were
open
for
dinner
offered
tapas
flights
wine
was
wildly
disappointed
when
abbreviated
their
hours
only
Their
drive-thru
option
call-ahead
orders
almost
makes
up
lack
hours
though
can't
tell
you
how
fabulous
call
ahead
order
Salad
pay
receive
from
window
without
having
unload
kids
car
take
them
inside
wait
order
then
back
out
get
loaded
again
A
word
warning
This
not
fast
food
Though
find
atmosphere
welcoming
children
kid's
high
chairs
times
waited
longer
than
would
liked
or
felt
necessary
Since
surmise
those
might
be
suggest
dining
if
your
unable
entertain
themselves
at
table
hurry
However
favorite
restaurant
look
forward
enjoying
healthy
creative
consistent
options
as
often
possible
Was
out
there
this
past
weekend
and
took
my
boyfriend
for
his
first
taste
of
Dim
Sum
on
Sunday
Uuugghh....so
not
what
I
was
expecting
see
the
dollar
value
it
wasn't
worth
we
paid
They
didn't
have
spicy
mustard
their
red
chili
sauce
tasted
old
Their
sticky
fried
rice
costs
4.99
That's
expensive
something
so
little
Everything
ate
barely
warm
to
cold
saw
they
heated
some
items
up
in
microwave
from
cart
because
obviously
sitting
long
enough
cooled
down
stuff
worse
got
favorite
taro
wrapped
meat
that
is
lovely
brown
flaky
crust
but
Then
second
which
shrimp
sugar
cane
That
cold
disappointing
service
good
unfortunately
that's
all
say
about
place
I've
had
better
would
recommend
place
anyone
nor
come
back
again
Myself
and
my
Wife
went
to
the
Gyro
Kebab
House
had
a
wonderful
meal
Not
only
was
meal
awesome
staff
were
friendliest
people
I
have
met
of
just
about
any
restaurant
been
in
USA
spent
many
years
overseas
pinch
myself
because
thought
still
there
The
food
excellent
Staff
very
friendly
am
serious
when
say
this
but
they
treat
you
like
there
own
family
Just
there
last
evening
after
a
12
hour
shift
at
work
ordered
Rachel
sandwhich...received
reuben
The
server
apologized
and
offered
to
get
the
correct
sandwhich
for
me
go
She
brought
it
table
packaged
I
drove
all
way
home
moon
township
opened
my
container
found
another
reuben
sandwhich.....disappointing
say
least
fries
were
great
however
Nothing
better
than
fresh
baked
bread
Cobs
is
our
favorite
The
sweets
are
delicious
Apple
Danish
the
best
Cinnamon
buns
Mmm
Scones
heated
with
butter
can't
beat
cheese
breads
and
buns
a
great
addition
to
bowl
of
soup
at
lunch
Can
you
tell
we
basically
build
meals
around
goods
Michael
and
Leanne
are
great
After
an
absolutely
terrible
experience
at
a
nail
salon
across
the
street
I
wandered
in
to
Modern
Nails
found
real
gem
The
interior
is
clean
well
appointed
but
not
fancy
They
recently
upgraded
their
pedicure
chairs
new
ones
very
cute
comfortable
with
LED
lights
massage
think
my
favorite
thing
about
how
friendly
talkative
everyone
is
Whenever
go
there
room
employees
customers
involved
animated
discussion
even
strangers
who
sitting
next
each
other
getting
nails
done
pedicures
here
thorough
girls
always
conscious
of
any
special
physical
needs
clients
have
pinched
nerve
leg
they're
accommodating
wacky
way
need
bend
knees
don't
get
done
often

definitely
support
this
wonderful
family
owned
business
Had
a
gentleman
help
me
this
evening
Not
only
am
I
thrilled
that
got
the
cutest
Jackie-o
inspired
bag
timeless
classic
piece
but
also
have
to
say
sales
associate
was
very
helpful
kind
of
interrupted
him
with
another
person
who
clearly
wasn't
going
buy
anything
And
he
just
in
most
friendly
manner
helped
go
through
shoes
and
bags
had
give
shout
out
Gucci
for
that
It's
important
good
rapport
staff
when
you're
high-end

You
wanna
pick
piece
not
feel
neglected

FOOD
My
mouth
is
watering
thinking
about
the
spinach
dip
smoked
salmon
apps
The
grilled
like
butter
melting
in
your
mouth
I
have
never
had
better
spaghetti
squash
brussel
sprouts
or
braised
cabbage
with
goat
cheese
Their
salads
are
also
fantastic
dare
you
to
find
a
creamy
blue
cheese
dressing
Mmmmm
want
some
right
now
Very
happy
with
my
clean
floors
Owner
very
nice
he
came
and
gave
the
estimate
then
did
job
On
time
all
furniture
back
in
place
price
as
previously
stated
Really
definitely
use
him
again
It's
too
bad
people
have
given
this
place
poor
reviews
based
mostly
on
price
I
mean
you
been
to
Vegas
before
Everything
is
more
expensive
than
other
places
That
said
was
really
impressed
with
the
quality
of
sushi
here
and
found
prices
be
totally
reasonable
by
standards
We
showed
up
at
7:30pm
a
Tuesday
night
wait
25
min
they
don't
take
reservations
actually

better

One
of
the
items
I
bought
was
tasty
one
old
and
stale
My
big
complaint
rudeness
cashier
trying
to
use
my
credit
card
because
low
on
cash
The
machine
rejecting
cashier
insisted
it
a
card
showed
her
word
debit
no
avail
It
is
only
debit
own
would
have
been
so
easy
be
nice
say
I'm
sorry
your
doesn't
work
But
she
basically
called
me
an
idiot
won't
back
This
especially
surprising
from
company
with
some
connection
Japan
A
retail
in
Japan
never
treat
customer
like
this
This
place
is
not
your
normal
taco
place
this
serves
street
tacos
like
you'll
find
in
LA
and
San
Diego
when
you're
wandering
around
I'm
a
fan
of
obviously
it's
super
convenient
located
quick
walk
from
campus
the
free
wifi
bonus
too
chicken
tacos
but
really
all
are
good
I
was
even
pleasantly
surprised
by
potato
first
time
tried
it
The
toppings
traditional
definitely
need
to
be
spiced
up
for
my
taste
lo
behold
there
20
different
hot
sauces
try
You
can
ask
owner
or
cooks
suggestions
they
know
have
Also
how
you
love
that
does
great
Tuesday

Fresh
Real
Turkey
Are
you
kidding
me
it
was
like
a
sandwich
you'd
make
yourself
the
day
after
Thanksgiving
Not
processed
meat
but
real
thing
Ummmmm
On
top
of
that
everyone
nice
and
upbeat
I
had
great
lunch
bit
lite
pleasant
conversation
left
full
satisfied
just
gotta
find
one
these
Capriottis
near
my
house
hope
they
are
as
good
this
one
I
had
a
flat
tire
in
my
on-street
parking
spot
and
called
several
nearby
auto
mechanics
nobody
could
stop
by
finally
Stickles
he
was
here
within
30
minutes
the
job
done
10
after
that
He
also
gave
me
few
tips
hope
don't
need
his
help
anytime
soon
but
would
definitely
call
him
again
highly
recommend
We
bought
the
happy
half
hour-It
was
most
amazing
experience
great
views
service
drinks
AND
THEN...a
guy
peed
in
trash
can
Drink
service
stopped
Felt
bad
for
all
on
board
but
no
apologies
from
company
A
buzz
kill
I've
been
to
several
popular
ramen
spots
throughout
Las
Vegas
and
even
in
LA
and
I
have
say
still
use
Fukumimi
as
the
bar
by
which
other
places
will
be
judged
This
unassuming
little
shop
sits
just
outside
busy
Strip
life
where
you
can
relax
enjoy
a
nice
bowl
of
piping
hot
tonkotsu
topped
with
their
tender
flavorful
pork
belly
chasu
perfectly
seasoned
nitamago--ask
for
extra
noodles
when
find
yourself
wanting
more
trust
me
will
Our
staple
favorites
range
from
spicy
delicious
kara-miso
hearty
tantan
men
ramen
also
carries
complementing
side
dishes
such
juicy
chicken
karaage
well
savory
agedashi
tofu
only
best
described
umami
So
if
crave
quick
meal
take
detour
off
The
make
drive
Fukumimi--you
won't
dissappointed
I
order
rapid
pick
up
food
was
ready
on
time
Panera
is
great
overall
every
where
go
pretty
nice
the
employees
are
always
energetic
and
friendly
I
order
take
from
menu
posted
online
and
was
charged
totally
different
prices
nearly
double
Also
changed
for
items
than
ordered

This
is
a
nice
sushi
spot
right
inside
the
forum

at
Caesar's
palace
We
came
in
for
happy
hour
and
I
got
sampling
of
items
including
some
sashimi
grand
total

Food
so
pricey
here
it
was
great
to
come
across

outside
fast
food
this
price
point
Their
menu
limited
but
they
still
have
variety
rolls
sashimi
hot
appetizers

Service
excellent
Las
Vegas
must
sent
memo
all
restaurant
service
workers
because
everywhere
we
gone
has
nicest
people
Wow
Awesome
service
delicious
food
great
prices
and
atmosphere
I
understand
why
this
place
has
5
stars
rating
is
a
hidden
gem
Even
the
chef
came
outside
to
ask
if
everything
was
okay
say
thank
you.Little
things
like
that
go
along
way
My
boyfriend
kept
talking
about
experience
we
had
on
our
way
home
Definitely
coming
back
Yes
ALL
target's
are
pretty
much
the
same
but
for
some
reason
I
like
this
one
just
because
it's
SOOO
clean
Compared
to
ones
I've
been
in
California
IT'S
SO
CLEAN
And
they
have
everything
Not
once
did
see
something
out
of
stock
That's
very
rare
California
I
came
here
while
waiting
for
the
track
tour
You
seat
yourself
but
there
was
a
waitress
that
to
get
our
order
The
menu
is
fairly
simple
salads
burgers
and
sandwiches
ended
up
getting
Mo's
Steak
Sandwich
It
on
toasted
bun
decent
side
steak
covered
in
bell
peppers
mushrooms
onions
cheese
pretty
tender
except
one
piece
of
gristle
Other
than
that
sandwich
delicious
fries
were
cooked
perfectly
Definitely
would
come
back
when
visit
Las
Vegas
Motor
Speedway
again
Looked
up
a
place
to
have
good
and
inexpensive
dinner
when
we
found
this
on
yelp
decided
try
it
out
Located
in
the
quaint
friendly
clean
Tuscany
Suites
Casino
is
truly
great
enjoy
some
very
food
quaint
homely
atmosphere
We
were
sat
at
our
table
quickly
waiters
provided
specials
of
day
Our
food
came
out
rather
quickly
happy
with
choices
had
dinner
back
for
breakfast
next
morning
enjoyed
much
will
definitely
be
going
again
Came
for
dinner
Menu
constantly
changes
so
you'll
find
some
really
cool
different
dishes
with
flavors
from
all
over
Everyone
raves
about
the
brunch
which
I
must
try
but
dinner
is
AMAZING
You
can't
go
wrong
any
dish
Lamb
ribs
mussels
pappardelle
and
homemade
rolls
Great
a
quiet
night
out
or
feast
their
mechanics
work
on
a
type
of
commission
So
they
will
tell
you
stuff
to
fix
when
it
doesnt
need
fixing
Two
stars
may
be
one
too
many
but
I'm
a
sucker
for
decent
happy
hour
Smokey
Bones
touts
their
bbq
don't
get
your
hopes
up
The
brisket
was
tough
and
even
bit
dry
I
suppose
enjoyed
the
unlimited
sauces
on
table
to
drown
it
all
out
My
group
felt
similarly
about
chicken
pork
as
well
still
know
how
feel
strange
cartoons
they
have
over
depicting
boneisms
There
are
surely
better
places
spend
time

Love
SANITY
Cute
and
chic
clothing
the
employees
kind
very
helpful
We've
been
customers
for
over
15
years
They
are
the
best
always
willing
to
accommodate
and
very
prompt
professional
BL-oom
or
BL-and
My
food
had
NO
flavor
whatsoever
I
the
short
ribs
Friends
lamb
and
steak
said
exact
same
thing
Forbidden
rice
was
completely
devoid
of
anything
resembling
a
flavor
Cool
decor
good
wine
list
not
sure
why
they
forgot
about
here
Prices
outrageous
but
for

there
are
tons
better
options
Style
no
substance
I
tried
out
the
kabob
platter
and
they
give
you
a
huge
chunk
of
food
However
service
is
as
slow
turtle
my
crony
were
only
ones
there
we
waited
for
long
time
to
get
our
Our
food

To
make

like
you're
walking
in
to
a
bar
that
you'd
find

Great
Gatsby
Very
elegant
and

The
Food
it
was
alright
Nothing
immensely
memorable
for

I
hoping

Best

So
very

they

I
will
definitely
return
next
time
am
in
Vegas
Okay
I
waited
a
few
days
before
started
typing
this
to
really
give
it
thought
and
come
at
you
as
objectively
possible
First
of
all
they
have
no
egg
rolls
Says
on
the
menu
but
don't
carry
them
however
Here
is
my
main
problem
with
place
It's
owned
by
SushiMon
which
an
absolute
terrible
sushi
restaurant
in
Henderson
it's
so
fact
had
make
new
one
name
entirely
website
about
get
far
away
from
that
sushimon
messes
up

The
major
are
extremely
unorganized
do
not
show
any
kind
professionalism
why
swore
would
never
eat
there
again
However
Goyemon
suckered
me
made
Product
mad
was
pretty
darn
disappointing
what
being
presented
asked
if
other
restaurants
area
that's
when
bomb
dropped
me
As

their
goes
I'm
sure
hired

those
portray
versus

rather

move
little
slow
I
have
been
here
about
seven
times
ordered
the
battered
fish
burrito
chicken
steak
pulled
pork
quesadilla
chips
and
guacamole
only
burrito
recommend
is
fish
Everything
else
really
dried
out
meat
regardless
of
if
it
morning
or
late
night
Today
I
experienced
the
best
customer
service
couldn't
have
even
imagined
how
great
this
day
would
turn
out
The
manager
of
Service
Mr
Jovan
Hines
not
only
had
pleasant
and
professional
phone
etiquette
but
his
professionalism
in
store
was
equally
appreciated
absolutley
recommend
anyone
to
for
any
all
your
Automobile
maintenance
needs
This
McDonald's
sucks
they
say
open
24/7
and
just
seating
here
in
my
car
the
drive
thru
with
kids
nobody
answers
me
for
order
very
bad
service
u
suck
It
was
ok
not
terrible
but
nothing
to
rave
about
They
over
charged
us
refunded
our
card
right
away
then
they
got
order
wrong
All
in
all
it
I
just
don't
know
if
will
go
back
give
them
another
try
This
was
definitely
a
very
memorable
experience
Not
all
foods
were
5
star
but
the
entire
atmosphere
service
cleanliness
and
most
items
absolutely
Star
Will
be
returning
again
next
time
we're
in
Vegas
Wow
this
place
has
really
good
local
style
food
It
would
do
well
in
Hilo
due
to
the
amount
of
food
and
cheap
prices
Kim
chee
saimin
a
flash(chix/beef
bowl
with
2
drinks
only
15
total
The
Bugogi
grilled
cheese
was
my
favorite
but
everything
else
I
had
delicious
too
Highly
recommend
this
place
I've
been
busy
and
haven't
really
got
a
chance
to
review
but
I
finally
today
moved
here
from
California
I'm
super
skeptical
due
the
fact
that
was
committed
same
talented
stylists
for
years
As
we
all
know
it
takes
long
time
find
the
one
However
friend
recommended
this
place
greeted
by
stylist
named
Ashlee
at
cute
little
room
in
back
of
nail
salon
She
made
me
feel
welcome
asked
if
I'd
like
anything
drink
expressed
wanted
go
darker
still
maintain
color
will
be
easy
light
again
love
result
my
hair
products
she
used
awesome
It
didn't
damage
left
salon
with
feeling
soft
shiny
felt
brand
new
getting
who
not
only
listen
truly
take
their
time
amazed
her
prices
couldn't
believe
it
pay
250-$500
get
done
so
steal
Keep
mind
next
you
guys
complain
about
prices
LOL
continue
support
independent
stylist
coming
soon
If
you
are
a
Rae
Dunn
hunter
at
all
even
if
pick
up
one
thing
with
this
store
than
the
employees
start
treating
like
crap
giving
dirty
looks
Then
managers
of
store
will
direct
to
not
bring
any
on
floor
until
those
people
looking
for
have
left
store
They
shit
customer
service
and
interested
in
pottery
then
treated
dirt
The
staff
at
this
location
is
very
friendly
I
have
leased
a
car
from
here
and
the
sales
person
Azam
Riffat
was
good
in
finding
us
deal
to
meet
my
budget
His
service
exceptional
also
come
its
decent
there
are
no
but
seamless
they
don't
play
around
with
words
ripe
you
off
as
other
Mississauga
Honda
location
They
an
house
wash
so
will
be
complimentary
wash
nice
mini
waiting
lounge
area
for
people
waiting
which
includes
TV
sports
or
new
playing
Free
Wifi
Magazines
New
papers
kids
area
We
had
an
awesome
time
there
last
night
They
have
a
new
menu
and
we
ordered
the
Brussels
sprouts
lobster
risotto
puppies
blackened
shrimp
Mac
cheese
Paul's
sandwich
So
delicious
loved
everything
Service
was
will
be
coming
back
again
Love
it
Had
a
sundae
with
truffle
trio

flavour
chocolate
ice
cream
chocolate
caramel
and
hazelnut
truffle
It
was
so
good
They
also
had
couple
vegan
options
if
that's
more
your
style
Super
cute
decor
excellent
music
playing
in
the
background
friendly
staff
and
free
samples
you
wanna
try
before
buy
Depending
on
what
order
it
can
get
little
pricy
but
no
than
other
shops
Toronto
Plus
large
scoops
Though
I
may
be
biased
since
live
nearby
I'll
definitely
coming
back
The
BBQ
here
is
so
good
I
was
in
town
for
a
business
trip

my
coworker
recommended
Thumb
am
very
happy
we
went
to
Thumb
tried
their
BBQ
store
also
really
cool
You
can
get
gas
your
car
detailed
shop
goodies
the
gift
shop
Its
real
one
stop
shop
Overall
I
have
decided
Terminal
C
food
selections
at
the
Phoenix
Airport
are
scarce
terribly
expensive
and
not
very
satisfying
This
Starbucks
in
particular
was
incredibly
slow
5:30
on
a
Sunday
evening
Worst
even
though
staff
saw
me
standing
behind
man
ordering
they
didn't
say
anything
to
about
designated
cue
which
empty
time
admit
it
my
fault
for
noticing
spot
wait
but
guy
front
of
see
either
ignorantly
followed
suite
Well
5
ppl
showed
up
manager
then
decides
tell
all
us
wait
cue
So
those
skipped
me
next
line
this
is
obviously
petty
major
nuisance
me
felt
situation
could
been
managed
better
just
seemed
like
apathetic
This
is
an
excellent
restaurant
that
I
believe
may
be
run
by
Korean
folks
who
bring
their
own
flavors
to
the
meals
The
seaweed
a
little
tastier
tempura
batter
and
sauce
are
sweeter
they
put
sesame
oil
in
food
etc
am
Japanese
insisted
on
staying
with
more
traditional
cuisine
but
after
trying
Mikado's
i'm
hooked
If
you
can
handle
spice
recommend
STST
roll
shrimp
tempura
spicy
tuna
Their
sushi
creative
fresh
tasty
prices
service
prompt
friendly
Go
check
it
out
won't
disappointed
This
is
like
having
family
dinner
at
home
when
no
one
feels
cooking
We
go
here
least
once
every
week
be
it
for
on
a
hectic
week
night
or
breakfast
the
weekend
In
all
years
we've
been
going
to
T-Bird
we
have
always
had
warm
friendly
service
The
food
cooking
Highlights
are
pot
roast
Mondays
and
served
24
hours
They
also
TVs
sports
fans
you
can
choose
where
want
sit

just
plunk
down
you'll
someone
there
help
within
minute
With
teenagers
it's
important
varied

Is
it
possible
to
get
cheap
ethnically
accurate
lunch
with
fresh
healthy
ingredients
prepared
a
modern
twist
right
here
in
Queen
City
Say
me
Sí
se
puede
I
went
ahead
got
quarter
chicken
plantains
salad
even
though
quinoa-stuffed
avocado
was
gently
whispering
Aubreyyyyy
my
ear
The
Peruvian
seasoned
just
blend
of
South
American
spices
give
that
extra
succulent
edge
but
without
overpowering
comforting
taste
we
all
know
love
Plantains
are
winner
every
day
Dat
salad
doe...the
dressing
they
put
on
INCREDIBLE
won't
go
into
great
detail
describe
it
I'll
only
say
you
have
try
believe
it
Based
above
would
five
star

But
bonus
points
for
having
alfajores
more
common
Argentina
than
Peru
tell
anyone
except
you
chic

Most

So
let's
see

alfajores

plus
few
more

I'm
feeling
generous

morning
12
stars
Have
seen
this
restaurant
a
couple
of
times
when
in
the
area
and
I
saw
Groupon
thought
it
was
great
excuse
to
give
try
They
seem
gave
some
deals
on

Tuesday
night
2-can-dine
for
69
they
also
have
Sunday
Prime
Rib
3-course
dinner
39
Neither
an
option
with
if
remember
right
Went
early
at
5pm
by
time
we
left
7pm
were
full
seating
people
their
upstairs
section
Not
sure
is
normal
so
would
recommend
reservation
Started
lambtini
we
ate
before
thinking
taking
picture
which
4
chops
presented
martini
glass
delicious
chutney
rocket
leaves
Really
enjoyed
start
us
off
tried

Chicken

Came

Swapped

Loved

not
just
peppers
good
mini
potatoes
Sauce
tasty
Everything
quite
except
as
heard
one
other
table
mention
real
imitation
crab
It
tasted
like
too
On
menu
did
notice
Pollock
Crab
but
figured
A
bites
you
didn't
flavour
love
been
or
all
The
Boy
has
tenderloin
steak
blue
escargots
More
overpowering
That
fantastic
thought
Perfectly
cooked
seasoning
meat
Absolutely
his
winner
We
went
dessert
had
7
that
instead
regular
2-3
options
Had
mixed
berry
bread

Just
vanilla
ice-cream
delicious
Might
trying
bunch
out
many

do
better
normally
gauge

more
than
looking
spend
it
took
everything
in
me
not
to
laugh
hysterically
when
my
14.50
salad
turned
out
be
3
slices
of
tomato
on
a
small
appetizer
tray
yes
really
the
12-16
burgers
looked
normal
sized
generously
portioned
and
had
fries
lettuce
tomato--all
usual
suspects
I
wanted
say
service
was
great
but
as
nice
they
were
staff
screwed
up
several
times
Finally
have
large
wi-fi
decal
wall
you
only
get
reception
from
pita
place
next
door
will
regular
fries
very
good
But
did
go
In-N-Out
immediately
afterwards
actual
dinner
This
used
to
be
one
of
my
fav
places
for
good
home-style
Italian
dining
Especially
a
late
night
dinner
because
the
kitchen
stayed
open
much
later
than
other
restaurants
in
Phoenix
I
had
heard
that
there
were
new
owners
and
am
very
disappointed
The
stingy
serving
bread
is
plain
ordinary
forget
about
getting
seconds
Alfredo
sauce
bland

like
maybe
it
was
from
can
pasta
over-cooked
reheated
slightly
above
room
temperature
service
so-so
Sad
I
agree
100
with
the
reviewer
Warren

The
star
of
KA
is
stage
was
more
mesmerized
by
stage
that
keeps
flipping
up
and
down
even
turning
from
horizontal
to
vertical
than
majority
performances
actors/actresses
Don't
get
me
wrong
did
enjoy
their
acrobatic
stunts
but
moving
main
highlight
for
me
have
never
seen
anything
like
at
before
its
just
breathtaking
how
it
able
transform
each
part
plot
One
my
favorite
parts
when
one
sibling
doing
shadow
art
his
hands
He
hands
into
shapes
a
bunny
kitty
etc
looked
really
cool
Another
girl
flying
over
on
ropes
her
love
interest
scene
very
romantic
amazed
ability
flip
turn
ropes
Like
many
reviewers
Yelp
am
still
bit
confused
entire
story
line
wish
there
some
narration
explain
what
happening
throughout
performance
All
know
are
two
siblings
who
got
separated
then
they
found
other
in
end
Please
fill

Overall
this
1

30

Always

another

this

a

We

a
regular

our

notorious
with
all
the
groomers
He
HATES
having
his
nails
cut
which
we
learned
when
he
was
puppy
They

great
job

Just
be
careful
if
you
park
across

young

killed
while
crossing
two
weeks
ago
it's
dangerous
especially
after
few
drinks
I
am
pretty
sure
my
friends
and
stumbled
into
a

party
when
we
came
here
for

The
lights
were

there
people
dry

by
staff

alike
All

this
would've
been
worth

if
it
weren't
food
We
ordered
vegan
pizza
couple
cheese
slices
an
order
garlic
knots
pizza
was
barely-cooked
pie
with
hummus
haphazardly
smeared
across
it
worst

they
had
attempted

but
some
reason
rather
than
sprinkling

ended
up
browsing

Man

It

through

they
have
They've

just
about

minute
wait
before
my
car
get
into
shop
didn't
mind
they
have
free
wifi
wanted
wander
over
look
at
new
trucks
anyway
In
about
10
minutes
saw
Town
Car
bounce
service
bay
The
mechanic
had
covered
seat
with
plastic
put
mat
on
floor
keep
tidy
You
can
watch
techs
work
your
car
feel
sorry
here
Would
you
want
constantly
watched
while
do
job
These
guys
are
display
like
animals
zoo
Anyway
thouroughly
My
getting
old
needs
some
maintence
Bill

but
not
near

5
stars
We
ordered
the
Wagyu
appetizer
and
spicy
tuna
roll
to
start
thought
both
were
amazing
so
excited
about
these
dishes
we
honestly
saved
a
bite
of
each
finish
our
meals
not
believing
entree
could
possibly
be
better
Well
here
comes
Chilean
sea
bass
let
me
tell
you
finished
on
that
course
It
was
simply
one
most
amazing
I
ever
had
in
my
life
The
bass
definitely
top
dishes
life
consider
myself
some
pretty
damn
fine
meals
wish
weren't
rush
get
somewhere
because
truly
eat
as
fast
possible
My
only
complaint
is
I'm
now
seeing
gotten
into
club
upstairs
with
dinner
purchase
although
couldn't
stayed
long
being
able
check
it
out
for
even
minutes
would
been
worth
add
experience
still
give
stars
bc
this
based
off
restaurant
experience
alone
Best
Red
Velvet
cupcakes
in
the
land
Love
their
pizza
and
garlic
knots
Delivery
was
really
quick
as
well
Will
definitely
order
again

Amazing
selection
and
quality
Bulgogi
gyoza
are
two
excellent
menu
items
if
you
aren't
a
fan
of
sushi
but
the
rolls
delicious
Same
Same
items
higher
prices
Not
impressed
Sweet
Tomatoes
has
been
the
same
for
years
nothing
new
or
improved
The
new
items
seasonal
are
worth
coming
in
imo
Love
concept
just
bored
of
overall
selection
hot
food
items
Would
much
rather
spend
15
dinner
elsewhere
Thanks
fresh
options
Please
find
some
entrees
that
really
get
people
excited
about
in
I
have
had
a
box
with
this
location
for
over
year
now
and
on
occasion
emailed
random
items
print
They
take
the
time
to
remember
me
sometimes
get
my
mail
packages
ready
AS
am
walking
in
from
car
Junard
must
be
favorite
because
he
seems
practice
highest
sense
of
urgency

but
everyone
dealt
there
does
their
job
well
A
guys
Our
first
time
having
wood
fired
pizza
and
we
thoroughly
enjoyed
it
the
staff
was
very
friendly
helpful
vibe
of
place
perfect
to
enjoy
our
gelato
great
relax
The
presentation
of
this
small
restaurant
isn't
much
tables
and
chairs
are
uncomfortable
more
indicative
a
fast
food
joint
That's
about
all
that's
mediocre
place
though
sandwich
combo
I
got
was
tasty
Turkish
tea
that
unique
pleasant
experience
They
have
free
refills
finished
my
meal
people
watched
on
the
patio
as
enjoyed
tea
It
reminded
me
drinking
Pilsners
in
Prague
last
summer
I'd
give
try
if
you
live
area
never
been
wouldn't
go
out
way
just
for
you're
town
however
Priced
high
for
mexican
food
Small
portions
Margaritas
are
over
priced
and
average
Not
very
good
well
last
night
i
go
through
the
drive
got
home
order
was
not
right
went
back
tonight
to
get
my
workers
and
worker
that
called
manger
in
few
words
your
lieing
we
poeple
here
all
time
trying
free
food
wtf
arby
coustermer
services
sucks
staff
lies
out
of
about
25
for
food
down
steling
from
me
azzholes
Stopped
by
here
for
the
1st
time
Staff
was
friendly
and
quick
The
food
great
I
had
breakfast
my
daughter
a
chili
cheese
dog
Both
tasted
delicious
We
will
try
to
make
it
back
soon
We
had
our
battery
tested
by
Gerald
and
it
turned
out
we
needed
to
replace
the
battery
went
above
beyond
with
his
customer
service
He
got
new
set
up
lubed
up
installed
into
vehicle
even
found
us
snap
screws
that
were
missing
under
hood
If
ever
need
anything
for
will
definitely
be
coming
back
this
Autozone
their
great
employees
Bought
my
2017
Jeep
Cherokee
here
Josh
and
Brady
were
amazing
I
had
looked
at
a
couple
dealerships
for
quotes
before
coming
to
Chapman
Las
Vegas
blew
the
competitors
out
of
water
am
super
happy
with
deal
got
The
whole
process
was
quick
easy
knew
what
looking

they
willing
work
me
felt
ease
entire
time
left
happy
no
BS
just
straight
point
way
it
should
be
David
was
quick
to
come
and
re-key
some
locks
after
a
recent
move
in
Very
friendly
had
an
eye
for
details
even
made
sure
my
other
were
in
perfect
working
order
Would
recommend
him
anyone
This
is
one
of
my
all
time
favorite
close
to
home
outside
patio
bars
The
fresh
fish
selection
pretty
impressive
too
For
bring
such
a
fancy
restaurant
I
was
pretty
disappointed
with
my
meal
here
The
service
great
but
food
mediocre
at
best
had
the
sea
bass
which
mushy
and
appetizers
weren't
so
great
egg
rolls
were
soggy
lobster
dumplings
good
ribs
good
tender
calamari
bland
Overall
for
price
probably
wouldn't
go
back
I'm
giving
this
four
stars
even
though
the
food
doesn't
blow
my
mind
or
anything
I
go
here
because
of
awesome
happy
hour
kitschy
atmosphere
and
entertaining
wait
staff
can
take
kids
no
one
blinks
an
eye
if
they
make
too
much
noise
Families
are
welcome
celebrated
also
stop
in
pick
up
out
a
lot
Their
tapas
menu
is
excellent
hope
place
around
for
long
time
First
time
here
Normally
visit
Hanks
at
Green
Valley
Ranch
when
we
venture
out
for
steak
I
had
the
ribeye
and
it
was
excellent
In
fact
one
of
best
I've
ever
had
My
wife
filet
lobster
tail
The
good
tail
dry
without
flavor
sides
appetizers
were
so-so
reason
won't
be
back
beer
selection
Yes
they
can
name
off
all
beers
have
but
are
obviously
upset
to
do
so
Second
their
selection
sucks
unless
you
want
Budweiser
miller
lite
etc
etc
asked
a
porter
which
goes
great
with
No
porter
an
IPA
Nope
amber
ale
Anyway
bar
manager
needs
fired
I'm
surprised
that
steak
house
such
good
reviews
wouldn't
take
add
couple
quality
craft
menu
I
love
Hyvee
West
Most
of
all
like
the
diverse
and
friendly
staff
feel
staff
actually
want
to
talk
me
say
hello
Don't
get
wrong
usually
I'm
fine
grabbing
my
k-cups
some
mac
cheese
running
out
never
saying
a
word
anyone
but
genuine
friendliness
in
aisles
at
register
often
makes
day

Thanks
I
really
liked
this
place
the
first
time
i
went
here
however
since
then
have
definitely
chosen
to
drive
distance
mesa
location
for
a
few
reasons
One
reason
being
that
is
kind
of
dirty
Another
sushi
here
not
nearly
as
good
other
location
They
use
way
too
much
rice
and
day
there
was
shell
in
lobster
roll
ate
It
scratched
my
throat
pretty
bad
Not
pleasant
at
all
Also
service
sucks
will
walk
by
you
never
refill
water
wait
approximately
20
years
get
your
check
meh
Came
into
this
facility
and
told
long
wait
did
not
offer
an
appointment
or
another
time
to
come
This
is
the
kind
of
greeting
a
business
should
give
I've
been
salons
where
it's
worth
but
when
you
cannot
smile
more
information
I
find
waste
my
money
tip
I'm
certain
they
will
continue
such
services
as
community
at
their
beckon
call
wouldn't
give
any
stars
Only
5
stars
for
ignorance
rudeness
prospective
clients
after
reading
reviews
returned
home
see
they're
ripping
off
whole
SCW
Do
patronize
Wow
I
don't
where
to
begin
Bertha
is
hands
down
the
best
went
her
for
a
deep
pore
facial
and
she
put
in
so
much
time
care
leave
my
skin
looking
perfect
haven't
had
face
look
this
smooth
very
long
time
She
passionate
what
does
it
shows
will
continue
go

The

I
was
able
move

less

15
minutes
last

Loved
this
place
came
with
my
baby
due
to
a
Groupon
deal
Waiter
was
super
nice
and
friendly
Ordered
4
rolls
edamame
It
all
delicious
No
bad
experience
other
than
parking
have
park
on
the
side
but
once
u
figure
out
it
great
place
Will
def
come
back
My
last
few
trips
had
been
rather
disappointing
The
portions
have
gotten
smaller
with
the
prices
increasing
quality
of
food
is
very
nice
but
for
cost
you
could
do
better
This
was
a
beautiful
show
the
story
line
clear
and
easy
to
follow
you
really
get
into
it
start
cheering
for
good
guys
What's
most
amazing
part
of
show
stage
how
helps
create
so
many
different
environments
I
love
details
there
were
OOOOO
AHHHHH
moments
feel
like
this
is
type
you
can
watch
over
something
new
from
every
time
we
able
tickets
BOGO

Complete
worth
it
Absolutely
amazing

This
is
now
my
go
to
spot

will
be
taking
friends
when
come
visit
On
a
cold
Saturday
night
we
found
gem
We
were
staying
nearby
and
wandered
in
after
checking
Yelp
The
place
is
warm
comfy
friendly
sat
upstairs
which
was
spacious
waited
on
without
delay
I
enjoyed
Lake
Effect
IPA
with
my
fish

chips
partner
raved
about
the
burrito
and
he
rarely
raves
so
this
quite
an
endorsement
would
definitely
return
if
are
area
again
I
can't
say
enough
good
things
about
this
place
Friendly
fast

professional
service
done
at
a
reasonable
price
They
are
someone
you
can
trust
to
fix
your
plumbing
the
only
plumber
that
will
use
for
my
house
My
boyfriend
and
I
came
here
on
New
Years
because
we
had
passed
it
several
times
before
without
going
in
was
surprised
to
find
that
not
a
dive
bar
but
nicely
put
together
local
hang
out
The
people
inside
seemed
like
regulars
selection
average
the
bartenders
were
responsive
Probably
place
I'll
go
back
fun
different
experience
have
One
of
my
favourite
local
places
to
stop
by
for
a
treat
Great
concept
friendly

welcoming
staff
and
doughnuts
that
really
are
something
special
The
vintage
tees
pretty
awesome
too
Well
now
one
doesn't
expect
much
when
coming
to
Walmart
but
I
was
sorely
disappointed
by
today's
visit
thanks
our
checkout
person
Phoebe
who
clearly
didn't
want
be
at
work
today
She
never
spoke
Just
started
ringing
up
my
stuff
could
get
over
that
she
throwing
stuff
in
the
bags

literally
things
done
See
attached
video
Unfortunately
time
pulled
out
phone
video
down
just
clothes
same
force
used
with
bread
boxed
goods
and
everything
else
The
shirts
you
see
her
bag
here
were
nicely
folded
sit
a
crumpled
mess
bag
don't
know
what
problem
is
if
deal
public
shouldn't
have
applied
retail
And
where
heck
Walmart's
management
Do
they
care
It
so
ridiculous
Terrible
customer
service
and
food
was
NOTHING
to
write
home
about
We
called-in
for
our
at
6:49
on
Friday
told
4
entrees
pineapple
fried

take
20
minutes

the
woman
who
answered
phone
ordered
pickup
not
delivery
got
there
a
little
before
time
waited
waited...and
waited
waited
45
mins
I
finally
lost
patience
found
hostess
back
counter
did
look
as
if
she
terribly
busy
asked
where
my
why
it
taking
so
long
her
that
three
people
came
after
me
left
with
their
large
orders
She
said
these
placed
orders
did
why
you
tell
then
And
had
nothing
say
went
into
kitchen
already
sitting
because
immediately
brought
up
paid
left
When
we
home
like
said
special
salad
tasted
weird
Don't
know
most
give
great
reviews
There
are
numerous
decent
Thai
places
here
in
Vegas
this
place
is
one
will
be
giving
business
again
feel
cheated

Walked
out
last
night
Got
seated
right
away
but
no
server
come
to
the
table
and
we
left
The
guy
next
us
just
got
his
water
after
waiting
a
lengthy
period
of
time
was
not
happy
Two
tables
down
family
returned

because
they
were

Not

nice

bad
service
i
tried
to
get
drink
at
the
bar
and
they
ignored
me
for
several
minutes
eventually
just
walked
away
Gourgous

It's

Sushi
quality
is
not
bad
for

Although
I
to
say
this
place
overall
seems
bit
filthier
than
when
it
first
opened
especially
the
floor
There
were
ten
hungry
girls
in
my
party
and
we
ready
to
eat
Unfortunately
the
service
is
biggest
complaint
about
this
place
I'm
not
sure
if
it's
because
waitress
wasn't
used
working
our
section
our
table
was
only
one
she
had
section
they
understaffed
or
just
disappeared
a

Not
once
but
twice
someone
from

look
for

It
took
awhile

then

One

that

When

Other

So

Overall

group
I've
worked
with
these
guys
3
times
and
each
time
I
was
blown
away
by
their
professionalism
ease
to
work
with
the
quality
of
finished
product
My
favorite
studio
in
Vegas
Highly
recommend
Attentive
service
and
very
helpful
when
asking
about
certain
products
opinions
upon
them
Whenever
I'm
in
Toronto
I'll
stop
by
again
Super
cute
store
Organic
makeup
is
the
future
This
place
is
delightful
I
went
there
for
lunch
on
several
occasions
and
would
go
more
frequently
if
my
budget
allowed
it
They
have
great
specials
delicious
sandwiches
yummy
yucca
fries
Their
chicken
sandwich
was
out
of
this
world
had
itty
bitty
shoestring
fries
top
that
make
it
awesome
Great
selection
import
sodas
Good
location
as
far
banks
go
Nice
tellers
See
Luz
an

She
will
take
care
of
you
The
Great
Greek
used
to
be
my
favorite
place
for
lunch
or
pick
up
But
that
changed
today
last
time
I
picked
up
the
food
was
just
okay
Salad
with
mushy
tomatoes
So
figured
maybe
an
off
day
Today
ordered
same
as
always
2
salads
two
med
rare
steak
skewers
When
got
home
once
again
tomatoes
but
this
so
well
done
could
not
eat
it
Two
both
charred
Not
sure
what
happened
in
couple
of
months
I'll
back
I'm
torn
I
truly
went
into
this
location
knowing
a
lot
of
negatives
from
past
visits
and
we
are
talking
years
experiences
My
husband
basically
boycotted
Bocktown
for
their
prices
lack
happy
hour
specials
and
most
2012
crappy
slow
service
So
ventured
there
tonight
predicting
place
that
would
produce
negative
review
was
pleasantly
surprised
Yes
have
our
list
negatives
but
food
the
service
were
decent
That
nice
change
past

The

It's

Light

In

It's

They

it
easy

However

minutes
All

one
but
they
quickly
brought

The

ran
back

panting
so
that
cute
overall

good
They

actually
nice
thing

I've
come
here
quite
a
few
times
over
the
past
year

and
pies
are
very
good
I
do
have
to
say
braised
beef
was
tad
too
sweet
for
my
liking
fries
good
but
could
be
more
Crispy
flavourful
they
just
little
bland
The
chicken
cheddar
mash
is
fantastic
so
well
balanced
inclusion
of
leeks
addiction
that
really
makes
this
pie
stand
out
also
think
crust
extremely
made
make
these
something
special
would
definitely
recommend
eating
I

But

My
husband
and
I
selected
this
hotel
for
our
entire
wedding
party
guests
to
stay
The
staff
there
was
very
rude
We
rented
15
plus
rooms
all
together
the
service
we
received
horrible
Their
security

virtually
non-existent

Dined
here
last
Friday
5/16
and
it
was
terrible
I
1/2
full
when
we
entered
ask
the

how

Broth
I
do
have
to

then
naturally
and
set
a
preference
for
this
type
of
over
other
selections
It
was
Milky
at
the

time
is
always
satisfying

like

Unfortunately

Noodles
believe
highly
discussed
when
anyone
goes
so
will
also
give
my
honest
opinion
slurp-able
uses
Straight
style
rather
than
Wrinkled
which
needs
longer
slurp
consume
small
wrinkled
could
done
are
more
playful
most
us
accustomed
as
well
CHEW
after
where
dislike
it
somewhat
Spaghetini
Ramen
with
an
Al-dente
core
means
you
bite

it
doesn't
bounce
back
uncooked
mid-core

with

I
had
the

tasty

My

Just
passing
through
Phoenix
on
our
way
to
Sedona
and
wanted
grab
a
bite
near
the
airport
Did
quick
search
decided
give
this
go
Neighborhood
is
funky
artsy
still
bit
transitional
It's
not
large
place
so
we
almost
missed
it
We
were
sat
in
backyard
under
tree
Even
at
2
pm
there
was
steady
crowd
had
breakfast
burrito
shrimp
chips
ah-maz-ing
Churro
Ice
Cream
Sandwich
The
french

spectacular
seasoned
with
variety
of
spices
just
hint
lemon
juice
I
would
have
never
thought
putting
juice
fries
but
loved
it
But
standout
definitely
churro
ice
cream
sandwich
Crunchy
cinnamon-y
lightly
fried
halves
filled
homemade
vanilla
bean
that
gave
right
amount
sweetness
A
total
mess
eat
worth
every

Would
stop
back
whenever

Are
there
new

What
happened
to
all
the
friendly
faces
I
used

This
is
probably
my
last

here
The

this

left
more
desired

bananas
were
on

I've
had
some
good
times
here
but
unfortunately
it
seems
move
on
I
have
been
working
out
for
close
to
2
decades
now
had
peaks
and

When

Don't

Anyway
prime

they

some
great
Pork

Something
speaks
itself
so
I'll
end
my
review
with
by
far
BEST
town
As
the
welcome
mat
for
my
most
recent
visit
to
land
of
Cleves
Hopkins
airport
leaves
a
bit
be
desired
The
shows
some
age
being
refurbished
in
places
but
still
wear
and
tear
lot
dirty
shoes
Movement
through
is
not
as
efficient
other
big
city
airports
ground
transportation
challenging
at
times
My
favorite
was
sign
curb
where
rental
car
shuttle
used
be
Sign
says
simply
Shuttles
have
moved
Okay
got
it
Where
exactly
mellow
mushroom
is
hands
down
the
best
place
for
beer
in
north(westish
valley
great
craft
selection
a
ton
of
rogue
varieties
on

and
even
more
thebottle

reverse

all
alcohol
half
off
appetizers
are
off
grilled
jerk
wings
a
capri
salad
paired
with
tasty
brew
you
cant
go
wrong
oh
ya
pizza
combinations
awesome
too
Very
mediocre
Best
thing
we
ate
were
the
french
fries
and
truffle
ketchup

food
wasn't
very
impressive
I
love
this
place
MACARONS
They
have
it
only
during
dinner
time
and
actually
taste
good
This
place
is
kind
of
like
wooden
spoon
buffet
but
better
The
food
on
little
dishes
as
well
good
though
There
was
so
much
to
pick
him
would
say
the
crab
leg
best
because
i
got
mines
hot
right
out
pot
that
option
btw
cold
one
far
left
side
towards
very
end
line
will
come
back
for
sure
I
LOVE
Francesca's

You

just
chillin
girls

Some
people
said
store
is
expensive
but
think
it's
reasonably
priced
They're
prices
are
comparable
to
other
stores
quality
of
their
clothes
very
good
I've
been
a
few
Francesca's

Service
okay
but
the
waitresses
have
too
many
customer
handle
at
once
The
cover
charge
a
little
much
bartenders
are
horrible
Ever
watch
Bar
Rescue
and
see
what
horrible
do
They
pretty
much
do
same
thing
For
instance
when
they
use
cocktail
shaker
flip
glass
around
it
drain
has
their
dirty
hands
all
over
now
of
that
in

Nasty
Drink

I

Thank
you

care
giving
outstanding

Compared
to
all
the
other
car
wash
places
choose
from
this
is
best
that
I
have
found
The
staff
does
a
great
job
before
you
enter

sure
bugs

removed
from
my
car
2
words....protein
pancakes
These
pancakes
are
amazing
They
made
with
blueberries
and
some
other
things
including
almonds
have
a
taste
of
cinnamon
also
Their
eggs
skillets
usually
pretty
good
too
but
every
time
I
go
to
get
the
protein
never
had
wait
for
table
typically
early
breakfast
The
service
has
also
always
been
good
complaint
about
it
It
is
definitely
one
my
favorite
places
The
service
is
very
slow
I
was
the
only
car
in
drive-thru

it
took
10
minutes
to
make
my
sandwich
didn't
order
any
sides
just
a
sandwich
still
minutes
went
at
11am
on
Saturday
there
were
several
workers
standing
around
doing
nothing
Had
a
pedicure
done
and
did
good
job
Very
relaxing
didn't
have
any
wait
at
all
when
I
arrived
Love
their
pizza
The
sandwiches
of
course
too
I
like
the
salami
or
bacon
egg
and
cheese
with
buffalo
sauce
I
am
happy
with
my
system
There
were
a
few
bumps
in
the
road
installing
cameras
outside
but
that
had
more
to
do
router
being
bad
area
of
house
so
signal
was
having
trouble
reaching
Unfortunately
it
took
visits
from
technician
and
wee
bit
trial
error
than
would
have
liked
said
they
always
very
professional
Alvin
installer
called
when
he
on
his
way
quick
setting
new
appointment
I
didn't
wait
weeks
between
never
tried
give
bogus
reasons
for
why
work
They
said
get
fixed
did
Bed
bugs
Needed
to
see
the
doctor
after
staying
at
this
hotel
Spoke
with
management
but
they
acted
like
didn't
care
Lost
a
customer
Really
love
the
coffee
but
sometimes
there's
a
lot
of
kids
outside
and
someone
playing
guitar
you
can't
sit
enjoy
But
I
prefer
Dunkin
over
Starbucks
any
day
so
will
continue
to
use
my
local
Dunkin
Donuts
I
love
the
food
Love
for
environment
eh
not
so
much
Mom
and
missed
our
reservation
at
Cowboy
Ciao's
on
a
Friday
night
worker
recommended
us
to
visit
sister
restaurant
Kazimierz
Ok
we'll
go
as
long
they
have
famous
Stetson
Chopped

My
mom
loved
salad
when
she
went
Ciao
So
we
enter

dark
How
heck

read
menu
We
had
no
idea
how
seating
worked
asked
worker

The

But

You
were
warned
I
recently
had
a
few
sets
and
fills
here
It's
way
too
expensive
for
the
pre
made
heavy
extensions
If
you
go
to
real
certified
tech
volume
set
takes
3
hours
I'm
not
sure
how
they
get
theirs
done
in

1.5
The

eyes
would
barely

it's

We

at
this
practice
for
8
years
What
I
am
about
to
write
does
not
reflect
on
the
care
we
received
from
him

feel
he
is
quite
a
good

but
has
own
some
of
responsibility
re
how
his

treated

The

on
the

a
nice

lamb
fantastic
so

however
risotto
very
creamy
bland
on

that
as

I
think
something
gotten
left
out

or

forgot
taste
it
before
sending
kitchen
have
in

not

what
happened

we
would

but

will
visit
this
restaurant
again
Between
the
hustle

bustle
of
strip
is
not
only
a
Korean
BBQ
restaurant
but
24hour
Restaurant
It
was
around
3am
we
ordered
Bul
Go
Gi
and
Galbi
it
full
taste
fresh
fantastic
The
portions
were
HUGE
We
super
hungry
so
able
to
finish
both
orders
But
one
would
have
sufficed
Also
even
though
just
time
drunks
be
rolling
in
service
great
Buffet
by
day
night
I
think
so
We
visit
Aria
pretty
regularly
as
my
husband
plays
in
their
poker
room
often
so
we've
been
looking
forward
to
this
place
opening
up
for
a
while
Every
casino
needs
good
casual
or
two
eat
that
isn't
the
coffee
shop
No
Bellagio
Olives
doesn't
count
Anyway
all
I
can
say
is
GREAT
Now
we
like
straightforward
cheese
pizza
not
bells
and
whistles
theirs
was
honestly
best
pizza
either
of
us
have
had
much
anywhere
No
lie
This
comes
mostly
from
crust
which
on
our
perfect
Crisp
bottom
yet
still
chewy
plenty
those
great
dough
bubbles
you
know
what
I'm
talking
about
really
flavorful
The
sauce
delicious
too
spicy
sweet
And
also
perfectly
flavorful
super
stringy
you
get
gimmicky
cheap
totally
greasy
like...well
Secret
Pizza
total
grease
bomb
if
ask
me
salads
too
beet
salad
great
Something
special
want
splurge
which
did
atmosphere
pleasant
no
blasting
music
some
Vegas
restaurants
now
there
were
games
going
over
bar
it
felt
comfortable
casual
service
case
prompt
pleasant
So
yeah
around
an
emphatic
five
stars
place
can't
wait
go
back
I
get
a
facial
every
month
and
it's
honestly
the
best
I've
ever
gotten
done
before
Brittany
really
cares
helps
with
any
issues
I'm
having
already
noticed
results
of
smoother
glowing
skin
within
2
times
been
there
Definitely
recommend
Good
hand-tossed
pizza
They
have
a
couple
of
tables
but
are
more
delivery
or
take-out
place
value
and
even
affordable
if
you
take
advantage
their
specials
coupons
Always
wonderful
consistently
delicious
and
the
service
is
exemplary
I
make
it
a
point
to
savor
this
delectable
friendly
restaurant
as
often
possible

inside

know
main

incredibly
gracious
when
tending
to
a
crew
of

who
partied
at

He's

original
chocolate
matcha
flavour
offer
Japanese
cheesecakes
tarts
which
are
tasty
as
well
would
recommend
checking
out
O
is
probably
The
classic
Cirque
show
but
I
definitely
wouldn't
recommend
it
as
your
first
made
that
mistake
so
had
a
hard
time
following
what
was
going
on
There
were
spectacular
acrobatics
being
performed
would
have
fared
better
with
something
more
formed
story
line
like
Ka
my
first
show
Nevertheless
this
show
still
awesome
to
watch
Overpriced
totally
screwed
me
on
an
oil
change
because
I
accidentally
bought
the
wrong
Groupon
Instead
of
helping
find
right
one
to
still
save
they
just
credited
amount
had
spent
towards
total
Literally
would
have
been
cheaper
for
go
dealership
Didn't
even
do
a
good
job
washing
car
marks
outside
and
didn't
clean
my
seats
very
well
Do
not
here
Emailed
customer
service
never
heard
back
The
Groupon
is
worth
it
My
mom
and
I
practically
had
the
entire
theater
to
ourselves
this
past
Monday
afternoon
There
were
6
of
us
total
in
theater
You
walk
in
pay
pick
which
seats
you
want
sit
rest
is
history
The
fresh
carmel
cheese
popcorn
they
making
smelled
tasted
fantabulous
extra
comfortable
This
would
be
a
great
movie
come
for
date
night
Hmm

Plus
if
want
can
order
food
drinks
from
your
seat
as
well
Score
Skip
using
the
pharmacy
at
this
location
Long
wait
time
Too
many
other
options
to
deal
with
this
I
don't
think
this
is
owned
by
Japanese
people
food
was
o.k
nothing
outstanding
but
bad
either
I'm
from
Japan
so
guess
a
little
bit
spoiled
when
it
comes
to
Shabu
Shabu
It's
delightful
have
place
here
in
Las
Vegas
though
They
are
the
best
massage
I've
had
in
Madison
Great
work
at
affordable
prices
and
always
very
tentative
to
my
requests
I
would
suggest
bringing
a
pair
of
headphones
enjoy
your
time
This
is
my
first
time
at
this
location
Everything
was
great
Clean
Friendly
staff
It's
12:15
on
Thursday
and
it
wasn't
busy
Got
right
in
without
a
long
line
And
Arizona
Chicken
sandwich
delicious
as
usual
Always
a
great
time
watching
Pittsburgh's
pro
soccer
team
The
stadium
is
great
with
nary
bad
seat
in
the
house
and
super
view
of
downtown
Point
across
river
Concessions
are
good
quality
not
at
all
expensive
Tickets
almost
always
available
reasonably
priced
Great
fun
for
real
football
fans
Go
Hounds
I
just
got
a
patio
cover
built
in
my
back
yard
by
Ultra
Patios
They
did
fantastic
job
The
quality
of
the
work
is
excellent
and
they
were
very
flexible
providing
customizations
In
addition
timely
started
4
days
after
signing
contract
completed
about
hours
would
definitely
recommend
them
to
someone
wanting
cover
The
products
at
Detox
Salon
are
top-notch

my
body
and
hair
thanking
me
for
the
switch
to
John
Masters
shampoo
conditioner
I
also
love
facial
sponge
that
they
sell
there
As
haircuts
Caitlin
is
an
amazing
stylist
have
thick
curly
most
stylists
don't
know
how
give
a
good
cut
it
inevitably
ends
up
looking
shaggy
just
trim
knows
cut
will
maintain
bounce
She
lot
about
great
blowing
out
I'd
recommend
this
salon
their
natural
products
as
stylist
any
day
This
review
is
based
solely
on
my
attempt
to
place
an
order
by
phone

I
called
as
left
work
knowing
would
take
at
least
30
min
bake
Nicole
answered
asked
if
could
get
a
Sicilian
pizza
She
rambled
off
of
who
knows
what
her
what
that
was
can't
remember
she
it
but
said
they
do
not
have
told
ordered
several
times
wasn't
sure
why
was
so
complicated
again
did
type
pizza
nevermind
and
hung
up
If
you
are
reading
this
seen
previous
posts
can
clearly
see
DO
HAVE
delicious
It
frustrating
stopped
way
home
in
person
instead
only
because
husband
really
wanted
for
dinner
So
turns
out
the
Chicago
style
want
make
call
or
will
want
Ive
been
here
tons
of
times
and
my
favorites
are
the
salads
seafod
paella
desserts
The
food
is
pretty
good
overall
not
like
your
typical
buffet
chinese
dishes
a
bit
underwhelming
but
their
miso
glazed
chen
actually
good
They
serve
some
in
tiny
pots
which
make
it
look
more
appetizing
For
breakfast
I
really
omlet
station
cheeses
house
granola
very
crispy
apple
cobbler
sausages
This
place
wasn't
bad
but
it
anything
special
either
The
food
was
decent

nothing
fancy
I
ordered
the
chicken
sandwich
that
you
can
customize
with
any
of
wing
sauces
like
this
idea
and
my
good
just
very
basic
dry
breast
sauce
lettuce
tomato
liked
option
ordering
however
wanted
beer
list
great
too
staff
friendly
wouldn't
necessarily
recommend
going
to
J&L
Grill
The
Capital
Grille
was
a
great
experience
overall
staff
extremely
welcoming
and
courteous
I
had
let
them
know
it
would
be
first
date
they
pulled
out
all
the
stops
They
chose
very
romantic
table
setting
service
terrific
waiter
little
overly
friendly
bit
uncomfortable
toward
end
of
meal
setting
environment
were
highlights
For
price
felt
food
could
have
been
better
starters
we
ordered
mozzarella
tomato
salad
Caesar
salads
both
chilled
crisp
vinegar
spice
balance
for
good
entrees
got
salmon
special
bleu
cheese
encrusted
fillet
with
grilled
shrimp
cooked
perfectly
but
lacking
on
seasoning
Where
short
flavor
made
up
definitely
weren't
shy
seasoning
which
left
something
to
desired
surf
turf
steak
perfection
tender
sold
as
cream
base
infused
pepper
garlic
Unfortunately
just
few
morsels
blue
pressed
into
top
meat
Still
VERY
good
cut
steak
meal
bottle
wine
ran
me
150
ambience
believe
is
fair
I'll
most
going
back
give
chef
another
chance
WOW
me
Came
here
with
my
family
to
eat
and
told
the
our
sevrer
just
bring
all
best
items
out
don't
stop
til
we
said
so
hah
We
had
so
many
authentic
dishes
it
was
unbelievable
how
flavorful
every
single
dish
was
I
wasn't
disappointed
in
any
of
food
that
came
out
everything
tasted
extremely
fresh
delicious

You
definitely
can't
go
other
Asian
place
get
flavors
like
this
secret
handed
down
recipes
But
do
agree
patrons
there
is
a
slight
language
barrier
than
that
loved
this
place
Worthy
if
you
are
sea
food
lover
and
have
to
know
what
not
add
your
food
Nice
place
give
it
a
try
especially
really
hungry

Pop

wanted
to
like
this
place
but
it's
not
quite
there
The
Good
the
tortillas
are
far
better
than
most
average
Mexican
places
they
look
taste
homemade
though
slightly
on
thin
side
very
good
fresh
Speaking
of
fresh
is
just
that
fresh
My
first
burrito
was
carne
asada
it
had
a
decent
flavor
exactly
what
expecting
built
good
meat
juicy
cooked
well
so
good
tried
chorizo
hash
still
bland
flat
Instead
using
papitas
opt
for
hash
browns
leaves
mushy
lacking
textural
variety
read

that

I
sent
my

in
for
repair
because
Canada
told
me
to
do
so
They
did
not
fix
issue
and
now
is
telling
send
it
them
again
If
they
couldn't
diagnose
the
first
time
why
would
be
a
great
idea
AGAIN
This
just
asking
failure
DO
NOT
GO
HERE
ABSOLUTE
TRASH
I
would
love
to
give
them
a

The

How

4
star
review
to
place
that
has
as
much
free
popcorn
you
want
great
beer
and
food
Exactly
This
is
local
chain
with
several
locations
ended
up
here
after
hike

trip
CVNP
it
hit
the
spot
What
was
really
funny
giant
lizard
they
had
it
an
iguana
all
patrons
got
gawk
at
In
Florida
we
see
those
things
running
around
over
place
some
actually
eat
them
known
for
its
wings
but
also
good
burgers
huge
selection
of
beers
would
go
back
if
in
area
Did
mention
POPCORN
eat
I'm
a
huge
Cuban
fan
and
had
such
high
hopes
of
this
place
but
unfortunately
am
leaving
disappointed
Ordered
the
Lechon
Asado
lunch
portion
with
boiled
yuca
plantains
my
go
to
dish
Pork
was
cooked
very
good
marinade
incredibly
salty
point
being
overpowering
This
is
not
normal
for
dish
The
undercooked
tough
cut/chew
Plantains
were
great
also
pretty
hard
mess
up
All
said
price
great
at
6.95
flavor
quality
low
too
Too
bad
because
they
have
atmosphere
sitting
in
strip
mall
area
Way
better
service
than
other
major
metros
They
get
backed
up
on
holidays
but
if
you
a
drivers
cell
and
call
them
directly
they
will
come
pick
before
others
like
any
other
small
family
own
Italian
restaurant
Friend
service
of
course
that
they
business
they're
going
to

We'll

We
got
a
groupon
for
Qdoba
this
past
week
Rude
service
Only
2
on
staff
in
the
whole
place
Line
took
FOREVER
to
get
through
Luckily
our
Groupon
lowered
price
reasonable
levels
Normally
place
is
more
expensive
than
Chipotle
yet
not
nearly
as
good
Water
from
tap
tasted
horrible
Every
garbage
can
was
overflowing
with
trash
Dirty
tables
etc
Glad
it
half
off
but
I
don't
think
I'd
even
buy
another
here
This
place
is
huge
They
have
active
robot
animals
that
go
off
around
you
I
had
the
Rainforest
Pita
Quesadillas
and
enjoyed
them
However
my
FAVORITE
was
Coffee
Mocha
had
It
amazing
will
just
walk
in
for
drink
Not
completely
sure
of
name
it
since
they
don't
a
full
menu
up
on
their
website
Favorite
place
to
eat
in
Downtown
Mesa
Great
food
great
atmosphere
and
servers
Garlic
knots
meatball
sliders
pepperoni
pizza
all
excellent
We
have
been
going
to
B&H
since
it
first
open
We've
never
had
a
bad
meal
It's
well
priced
too
I
wish
they
would
keep
their
calamari
on
the
menu
all
time
and
off
several
times
being
my
favorite
dish
it's
disappointment
when
we
go
replaced
also
suggest
sparkling
water
San
Pellegrino
or
Perrier
cold
That's
not
kind
of
you
want
dilute
with
ice
But
other
than
those
two
things
give
5th
star
My
dog
is
always
the
only
one
in
there
for
an
apt
which
Iike
Super
clean

Jessica
awesome
Recommend
her
to

The
coffee
was
superb
Perfect
balance
of
bitterness
and
milkiness
in
the
iced

They
have

they

Verve

Ambiance
is

I'm
a

this

I
feel

there
are

going

Ladurée-style

Such
a
fantastic
company
run
by
some
great
people
They
do
job
pairing
convenience
with
exceptional
service
I
recently
had
lunch
here
with
a
few
friends
Even
though
they
were
really
busy
our
order
was
taken
quickly
and
meals
ready
way
sooner
than
expected
The
food
great
the
atmosphere
pleasant
definitely
recommend
anyone
who
enjoys
Mexican
to
try
this
place
out
Our
first
time
at
Tarbells
was
great
We
happened
upon
the
restaurant
by
luck
after
we
were
dismayed
from
crowds/long
wait
postino
and
LGO
Without
reading
a
review
chose
this
place
out
of
sheer
hunger
menu
Fish

A
nice

just

quite

treat

experience

Obviously
if
you're
researching
you
know
it
is
pricey
side
Since
hungrily
stumbled
in
had
no
idea
But
pleased
our
will
be
back
again
price
aside
the
food
is
pretty
good
but
I've
never
paid
more
than
10
for
a
bowl
of
noodle
soup
in
any
Chinese
restaurant
and
I
18.5
tum
yum
soup
it
was
good
though
we
also
had
stir
fried
veggie
Chinese
waters
spinach
couple
dim
sum
isn't
as
greasy
typical
which
appreciate
it
everything
expensive
on
strip
so
I'm
ok
with
just
enjoy
don't
think
about
price
Drs
Bryson
and
Margio
are
the
best
ones
in
town
I
look
forward
to
seeing
them
They
both
have
great
chair
side
manners
their
staff
members
friendly
knowledgeable
The
office
is
beautiful
very
clean
also
use
latest
technology
would
recommend
anyone
looking
for
a
dentist
make
an
appointment
with
The
store
itself
has
a
great
staff
very
professional
and
friendly
even
the
sales
are
awesome
pharmacy
is
quick
but
staff
seem
somewhat
judgemental
I
don't
want
to
name
who
because
still
go
there
one
employee
will
actually
make
faces
when
you
tell
her
your
medication
It
is
probably
pretty
obvious
but
this
place
quite
similar
to
Tram's
Kitchen
Small
hole-in-the-wall
Vietnamese
that
from
the
outside
doesn't
look
very
impressive
actually
provides
good
and
cheap
eats
Needless
say
their
pho
I
enjoyed
lemongrass
tofu
appetizer
as
well
Their
rice
plate
at
least
pork
chop
anyway
wasn't
too
so
I'd
say
just
stick
with
pho
It's
neat
they
have
more
than
two
or
three
options
of
each
type
food--I
think
do
a
better
selection
Tram's
Oh
hot
tea
fragrant
Good
and
quick
sercices
at
this
location
If
there
are
more
seats
for
the
guests
would
be
better
I
was
in
town
and
needed
to
carry
out
food
for
a
family
gathering
My

place
me

were

off
there
are

that
you
can
stay
at
walk
stadium
Some
only
5
10
minute
walk
The
stadium
actually
plain
other
than
having
retractable
roof
but
it
was
change
of
pace
as
feel
paying
more
attention
game
rather
walking
around
checking
out
all
bells
whistles
Lower
level
seats
in
outfield
reasonable
food
not
great
feature
here
beer
prices
wicked
about
ten

So
have
hot
dog
outside

enjoy
beers
after
I
ordered
the
almond
milk
tea
and
when
got
it
it
literally
tasted
like
sour
spoiled
milk
was
just
going
to
trash
but
my
friend
went
had
them
remake
this
time
as
a

since
that's
what
she
okay
So
get
it's
completely

Wow
I

have
found
the

always
watch

usually
avoid

food
but
Dallas
was
on
point
they
even
asked
me
how
I'll

got

with

This

is

quality

its

My

I
tried
it
out
had
so
much
fun
You're
competing
against
other

running
trying
complete

as
fast
you
can
Surprisingly
was
great

our

amazing
very
tentative

everything
I
asked

Everything

come

came

Although
most
the
food
was

infinitely

Utterly

nothing

Yes
that

STAY
AWAY

could
put

How

We
ordered
take
out
at
dinner
time
They
shorted
our
order
but
fortunately
we
live
close
by
and
returned
to
pick
up
the
missing
food
Everything
from
my
steak
wrap
wife's
chicken
salad
was
so
salty
that
it
almost
inedible
The
homemade
potato
chips
were
coated
with
much
seasoning
they
made
your
tongue
go
numb
Avoid
this
place
if
you
are
looking
for
quality
food
there
too
many
good
options
near
bye
The
last
thing
UW-Madison
needs

where

For
that
large

giant

Food

amazing
Interesting
menu
Great
burger
and
fries
Hipsters
at
Melt
should
come
on
next
door
for
some
real
food
a
wonderful
old
school
bar
Highly
recommend
I
love
coming
to
this
smoke
shop
They
have
everything
from
water
pipes
dreamcatchers
candles
jewelry
and
clothing
The
customer
service
here
is
always
on
point
more
than
one
location
but
I've
only
been
one
I
know
it's
just
an
airport
restaurant
but
Symon
has
a
reputation
and
I've
had
good
food
here
Not
today
Simple
omelet
Unseasoned
Overwhelmed
with
clear
vegetable
oil
of
some
sort
very
tasty
even
for
airport
Great
service
otherwise
2
stars
Needed
to
install
a
garage
door
opener
at
our
new
house
They
were
prompt
and
didn't
nickel
dime
me
as
there
was
extra
work
needed
install
Very
happy
with
the
they
cleaned
up
when
finished
Thanks
Will
call
them
for
any
future
needs
Price
very
fair
also
Came
here
for
breakfast
with
picky
eaters
We
had
chicken
fried
steak
on
point
if
you
are
southern
Green
polzoe
their
burrito
so
big
I
a
standard
American
eggs
bacon
and
potatoes
High
quality
yummy
tummy
The
food
here
is
amazing
My
favorites
are
the
Americana
Burger
Chicken
Fingers
and
Zucchini
Fries
Must
try
service
pretty
good
too
but
we
always
have
best
nights
when
Anna
our
bartender
because
she
keeps
glasses
full
she's
so
fun
to
talk
to
She
makes
us
want
come
back
all
time
Only
been
here
a
month
NOT
happy
Had
plans
on
bringing
In
traveling
nurses
to
rent
from
them
Managing
4
hospitals
Actually
had
one
of
my
sign
lease
line
Stopped
her
immediately
Don't
feel
like
the
treatment
is
consistent
with
other
tenants
regarding
complaints
I
have
received
From
family
Attorneys
and
Metro
law
enforcement
who
ADVISED
me
leave
as
soon
complete
Plan
it
I
love
these
little
donuts
No
matter
where
you
spot
the
truck

line
will
be
long
recently
caught
up
with
them
at
legacy
village
food
Monday

A
lot
of
people
were
ordering
donut
parfait
6

strawberry
shortcake
Boston
cream
or
oreo
cookie
also
smashed
lemonade
plain
strawberries
5)...I
wanted
to
try
looked
so
delicious

but
they
ran
out
strawberries...they
ingredients
for
parfait
My
only
complaint
this
visit
was
that
noticed
had
a
container
holding
already
fried
donuts
being
used
parfaits
those
who
just
got
fresh
hot
right
fryer
But
by
time
counter
place
my
order
believe
using
been
in
left
over
parfaits
which
not
hot
They
still
good
fresh
always
taste
best
pay
more
attention
next
make
sure
am
served
freshly
This
was
my
first
time
trying
rolled
ice
cream
and
it
AMAZING
I
ordered
the
choco
mania
which
basically
cookies

topped
with
whipped
cream
chocolate
sauce
an
oreo
a
wafer
the
menu
said
pocky
Their
is
very
photogenic

I'd
recommend
letting
sit
for
few
minutes
to
thaw
before
you
eat
it
It's
worth
hype
I'm
hoping
they
have
dairy
free
base
in
future
so
can
more
often
D
I've
used
QCP
for
several
months
now
to
walk
and
feed
my
dog
each
afternoon
because
I
work
long
hours
have
other
petsitting
services
before
am
extremely
impressed
with
the
reliability
personality
of
team
My
met
walker
in
person
prior
handing
over
a
key
house
immediately
felt
very
comfortable
her

took
instantly
she
asked

learn
about
understand
our
typical
routine
She
texts
me
nearly
everyday
updates
on
even
got
him
some
toys
Christmas
so
sweet
Not
only
does
walk
brush
but
also
takes
trash
curb
day
brings
any
packages
delivered
that
day
One
note
huge
advantage
is
they
many
walkers
you
are
not
bind
if
your
usual
sick
vacation
etc
has
given
great
peace
mind
who
coming
into
home
taking
care
dog
highly
recommend
them
Clean
establishment
with
nicer
quality
cutlery
There's
lots
of
seating
especially
for
groups
The
lights
are
dimmed
at
night
which
is
nice
and
they
do
serve
alcoholic
drinks
staff
also
very
nice
come
around
a
few
times
asking
if
everything
okay
you
want
more
radish
We
ordered
the
blazing
chicken
fried
rice
If
like
sweet
spicy
food
this
place
you
However
it
does
taste
similar
to
something
from
bourbon
street
grill
but
expensive
rice
extremely
oily
I
know
it's
I've
never
seen
glisten
so
much
wings
one
most
expensive

Any

highly
recommend
this
place
I
found
out
about
this
little
gem
through
a
friend's
facebook
post
and
am
glad
that
did
I've
got

so
anyone

Upon
arriving
at

From

with

A
nifty
idea
giving

While
sipping

started
sip
some
wine
Sure
most
salons
now
days
common
commodity
It
teamwork
friendly
service
from
everyone
won
over
Anytime
needed
something
someone
had
already
asked
or
better
yet
brought
it
me
Another
cool
thing
vibe
think
upscale
associate
attitudes
come
along
right
it
but
not
here
That
itself
huge
relief
Now
actual

Final
warning
newbies
chocolate
strategically
placed

This
establishment
is
deceitful
and
condescending
as
you
can
see
from
their
response
They
sell
products
purchased
on
black
market
do
not
have
certificates
of
Labaratory
analysis
It's
illegal
unethical
We
consumers
demand
that

pesticides
heavy
metals
No
health

company
These

got

The
broth
was
a
little
bit
too
salty
and
found
myself
very
thirsty
for
rest
of
night
portions
were
lower
than
average
especially
L-size
meat
slices
not
generous
Other
that
there
long
wait
time
our
meals
to
arrive
In
terms
service
servers
didn't
seem
understand
lot
English
We
asked
sriracha
sauce
but
don't
think
they
know
what
we
meant
female
server
seemed
mad/displeased
because
she
slammed
cups
water
on
table
as
put
it
down
probably
day
her
first
impression
Overall
would
come
back
here
again
probably
wouldn't
get
same
thing
have
deep
aversion

A
few

and
I
decided
that
rather
than
going

New

we
wanted

When

worried
they

but
still
seated
right

The

is
bit
crammed
every

There

Our

My

asked

silly
question
one
items
made
me
laugh
because
an
obvious
answer
he
answered
her
with
complete
professionalism
didn't
make

did
I'm
great

He

I
had
the
joy
of
staying
at
this
wonderful
property
CityCentre
My
room
a
fantastic

The
staff
was
friendly
and
helpful
Because
on
assignment
to
be
in
Vegas
for
five
days
Honestly
coming
back
hotel
highlight
an
absolute
assignment
from
hell
Whenever
didn't
have
time
go
out
eat
could
count
in-room
dining
provide
great
food

unlike
bland
tapas
restaurant
course
Thought
about
getting

but
read

Why

things

that

Love

Been
here
a
few
times
it's
always

I
felt
compelled
to
write
this
review
because
of
odd
service
my

received
Even
though
menu
mentions
ordering
about
2
items
per

share
apparently
for
2
5
total

was
too
much
For
parties
that
like
try

everything
suggest
coming
prepared
handle
being
questioned
your
choices
Although
don't
think
portion
sizes
are
big
if
you
having

Overall
great
place
but
needs
get
it
together
Very
Awesome
family

I
was
there
by
myself
and
could
tell
they
really
loved
their
food
wanted
you
to
be
happy
They
asked
if
it
my
first
visit
showed
me
what
think
are
best
offerings
love
when
a
business
cares
enough
talk
about
why
came
in
where
from
that
sincerely
hope
see
again
soon
This
place
oozes
authentic
good
vibes
Oh
the
is
great
Fast
service
Gorgeous
view
and
decor
as
everyone
else
said
The
food
was
unimpressive
but
on
par
for
the
price
which
30
per

at
cheapest
with

special

Of
course
given
product
I
would
recommend
against
ordering
more
expensive

Simply
come
here
to
enjoy

Went
there
for

I
loved

i
would
be
waiting
still
if
chose
this
place
Maybe
the
thru
is
better
Have
been
to
County
General
multiple
times
with
many
different
kinds
of
people
tastes
and
have
never
left
a
disappointed
person
My
preferred
day
visit
is
Sundays
In
the
evening
it's
relatively
empty
We
problems
getting
table
It
should
be
noted
that
rather
small
location
so
going
big
group
isn't
ideal
If
there
are
4
you
you're
fine
I
also
like
on
Sunday
evenings
because
absolutely
love
their
Sunday
Bunday
special
which
available
after
5
pm
fresh
made
sticky
buns
variety
fillings
sauces
served
apple
slaw

pork
but
they
veggie
options
The
sauces
in
little
squeeze
bottles
include
sesame
seed
mayo
poison
coffee
flavourful
potent
hot
sauce
All
this
comes
platter
some
assembly
required
prefer
can
choose
what
how
much
it
is
You
buy
extra
if
you
more

Dr

this
location
Hospital

Hurts

amazing
donuts
and
you
can
turn
any
of
them
into
a
shake

whole
donut
on
top
instead
lid
They
also
do
great
things
for
the
community
host
reading

charities
If
are
this
just
stop
go
straight
there
will
not
be
disappointed
While
the
AYCE
food
here
is
not
bad
they
have
absolutely
terrible
service
I
was
there
on
yesterday
a
Thursday
after
work
hours
sitting
towards
back
of
restaurant
The
waiters/waitresses
do
come
by
often
had
to
constantly
wave
frantically
for
them
see
us
As
result
we
get
water/tea
refills
as
often
at
other
restaurants
waitress
that
took
our
order
issues
hearing
wanted
one
dishes
canceled
upon
ordering
be
replaced
something
else
So
when
came
and
asked
her
take
it
we
want
waste
food
she
gave
up
nasty
glare
Then
dish
suppose
by-mistake
taken
never
and
so
did
remaining
ones
got
missed
well
followed
again
She
then
proceeded
say
you
BIG
or
SMALL
dish
you
know
if
don't
finish
PAY
it
Her
tone
truly
rude
I'd
been
Aji
Sai
much
better
service
than
what
experienced
last
night
think
like
this
restaurant
anymore
Great
place
great
food
price
and
super
friendly
staff
We
headed
here
after
visiting
the
Spring
Preserve
A
perfect
finish
I
must
say
And
our
little
baby
girl
loved
their
chicken...which
is
why
have
to
give
this
place
5
stars

picky

Longer

but
decided
stick

3
hours
later

I'm
a
big
fan
of
Asian
food
but
this
was
my
first
time
going
to
an
fusion
tapas
restaurant
I
had
mixed
feelings
in
we
went
for
friends
birthday
and
decided
rent
out
the
room
downstairs
The
free
you
just
make
sure
call
couple
weeks
advance
reserve
it
We
bought
bottle
sake
bunch
bombs
throughout
night

it
surprisingly
great
tasted
like
salami
Highly
recommend
place
with
friends
recommend
Great
place
to
have
a
fee
beers
with
friends
Friendly
atmosphere
and
great
staff
I
love
the
indoor
outdoor
feeling
This
is
by
far
one
of
the
best
restaurants
I
have
ever
been
to
loved
everything
that
my
party
ordered
bread
came
out
warm
and
fresh
chicken
Parmesan
was
absolute
had
small
little
hometown
feel
employees
were
all
very
nice
took
good
care
our
party
The
owner
talking
visiting
with
some
customers
he
stopped
table
had
a
conversation
as
well
It
great
meal
atmosphere
did
say
food
lol
This
pizza
is
the
best
i
have
had
in
vegas
thus
far
I
white
slice
and
it
was
so
yummy
A
bit
pricey
but
think
that
because
a
tourist
spot
Next
to
famous
pawn
shop
But
whatever
It
amazing
NY
style
pizza
And
staff
really
tentative
nice
This
is
now
my
go
to
place
Since
new
owner
took
over
service
has
improved
Quality
of
sushi
improved
too
You
spend
20-$30
for
two
and
leave
happy
What
a
value
This
was
the
contractor
that
provided
through
Lowe's
as
I
purchased
a
toilet
kitchen
faucet
P-valves
and
hoses
supply
water
p-valves
to
faucet
toilet
DON"T
USE
THIS
CONTRACTOR
THEY
ARE
THIEVES
They
called
say
they
were
on
their
way
said
call
me
when
you
get
here
didn't
call
1
hour
45
minutes
later
them
had
not
heard
from
them
Apparently
our
tenant
home
started
job
without
consulting
us
took
valves
them
in
van
tried
steal
materials
replace
We
charged
for
labor
have
firm
conversation
with
work
done
UNPROFESSIONAL
DISHONEST
THIEVES
DON'T
THEM
WOULD
GIVE
ZERO
STARS
IF
COULD
Just

10.99
for
a
champagne
brunch
in
Las
Vegas
Get
out
of
here...no
wait
it
is
true
and
actually
really
good
what
you
get
Eggs
Benedict
to
the
orange
chicken
but
my
favorite
was
country
fried
steak
bisquits
gravy
I
don't
know
people
expect
got
buffet
this
price
size
gotta
be
150
items
food
hot
me
tastes
good
Trust
I'm
picky
as
hell
ask
fiance
Anyways
place
again
way
above
average
price
If
guys
like
cause
your
eggs
were
little
too
moist
well
then
go
back
house
cook
them
yourself
that
so
do
alot
other
people
Don't
listen
negative
reviews
on
here
Those
are
unhappy
with
life
anything
else
they
do
Try
especially
if
suffering
from
hangover
need
some
belly
Hope
helps
The
new
Walnut
Grill
in
Robinson
looks

I

the
Beer
Battered
Cod
fish
sandwich
and
fries
was
HUGE
okay
food
came
out
hot
cooked
correctly
batter
not
as
crispy

I
love

this
could
be
good
place
for
happy
hour
future
Service
server
did
nice
job
polite
Food
Okay
correctly
but
some
looking
Price

They
have
lunch
specials
Many
their
items
start
over
10
average
12-14
believe
my
bill
15
I
have
mixed
feelings
about
this
place
The
food
is
delicious
which
the
most
important
thing
anyway
but
service
just
meh
Also
interior
a
little
cramped
up
with
not
much
elbow
room
between
tables
It
must
be
as
wide
train
compartment
While
we
were
there
they
always
had
lot
of
take
out
packs
waiting
at
counter
so
other
people
might
sharing
my
opinions

crowded
interiors
too
But
repeat
MIND
BLOWING
We
spring
roll
appetizer
which
was
okay
For
entrees
Pud
Met
Ma
Muang
cashew
nut
duck
duck
delicious
crispy
and
full

will
definitely
back
to
try
more
variety
or
maybe
keep
ordering
duck
do
recommend
This
Walmart
is
very
clean
and
well
organized
It's
not
as
big
the
S
Rainbow
location
but
it
feels
a
lot
more
family-friendly
They
also
have
nice
selection
of
UNLV
VGK
gear
Love
the
vibes
of
this
place
Cold
brew
coffee
was
excellent
lots
art
and
open
space
Definitely
coming
back
I
love
this
spot
downtown
Even
on
the
weekend
when
market
is
going
they
are
pretty
quick
with
food
Their
coffee
excellent
My
fave
breakfast
item
biscuits
and
gravy
when
Matt's
line
ridiculous
Sundays
come
here
no
wait
HORRIBLE
I
had
the
breakfast
buffet
while
staying
here
and
there
were
only
a
few
things
that
worth
eating
One
being
omelet
but
be
sure
to
ask
for
light
on
ingredients
Dinner
was
absolutely
putrid
Two
plates
neither
my
wife
nor
myself
able
stand
anything
more
than
couple
of
bites
our
plates
This
after
deciding
bypass
another
casino
dinner
in
favor
half
off
coupon
here
My
advice
please
stay
away
from
Garden
Buffet

South
Point
Resort
I
feel
like
a
princess
needed
little
me
time
so
decided
to
try
new
place
It's
beautiful
in
here
and
every
is
nice

I

Kevin
did
a

job
with
my

tissue/therapeutic
massage
He
took
the
time
to

where
I
was
feeling
discomfort
and

had
been
wanting

he
job
I'll
definitely
be
back
soon
The
cafe
is
cute
and
hosts
family/kid
activities
on
occasion
however
I
have
found
the
coffees
to
be
mediocre
Have
been
there
3
times
always
felt
underwhelmed
Haven't
tried
their
food
really
wanted
like
this
place
as
live
in
area
aren't
many
coffee
houses
around
This
La
Canasta
is
OK
I'm
sure
some
of
you
have
your
favorites
but
this
defiantly
not
mine
We
went
here
at
lunch
and
it
was
busy
over
packed
It
around
noon
They
don't
clean
off
tables
as
soon
people
leave
so
we
were
standing
awkwardly
asking
them
to
please
the
table
The
waitress
looked
us
with
are
talking
me
look
on
her
face
when
asked
if
could
get
a
table
cleaned
sit
down
chip
area
mess
My
food
didn't
arrive
until
half
my
coworkers
done
eating
I
ordered
soup
up
check
they
for
ticket
then
said
takes
little
longer
make
soup
BS
that
stuff
in
morning
You
just
slop
bowl
put
microwave
know
how
works
back
kitchen
Finally
came
20
minutes
later
Do
offer
refund
No
course
not
To
be
fair
good
But
its
same
every
la
canasta
owned
by
family
particular
one
part
group
can
consider
local
chain
mom
pop
also
own
Silvia's
would
recommend
going
staff
terrible
There
way
better
right
7th
ave
Phoenix
They've
got
a
lot
of
options
for
poutine
pre-set
and
build
your
own
Proportions
are
great

you'll
have
enough
to
take
home
some
too
I
came
here
because
my
american
brother
in
law
wanted
poutine
Although
there
restaurants
with
GOOD
poutine
as
one
their
dishes
this
place
allowed
us
really
sink
our
teeth
into
the
world
Solid
place
Delicious
food
I
ordered
the
Veggie
plate
and
combinations
of
vegetables
rice
beans
with
vegan
sour
cream
cheese
made
it
absolutely
flavorful
It's
nice
to
know
there
are
options
for
Latin
food
in
valley
Industry
is
our
neighborhood
go-to
place
for
a
beer
and
snack
or
sandwich
They
always
have
an
extensive
number
of
craft
beers
on
tap
that
changes
frequently
Everything
we've
had
to
eat
has
been
good
The
nachos
are
standby
I'll
post
photo
as
soon
I
remember
take
one
before
devouring
them
If
you
add
the
chili
they
can
serve
meal
two
or
at
least
that's
what
we
do
frequently
Just
beware
fresh
jalapeños
they're
often
pretty
hot
fish
chips
also
great
coleslaw
comes
alongside
really
tasty
creamy

vinegary
Their
house
fries
definitely
good
smoked
wings
buffalo
mac
n
cheese
flatbread
tasty
but
small
side
all
their
flatbreads
good
great

checking

been
This
may
be
the
worst
Thai
food
I've
ever
had--or
more
accurately
this
is
Chinese
had
as
establishment
not
actually
Thai
Not
that
necessarily
matters
but
in
case
authenticity
thrown
completely
out
window
and
quality
of
mimicry
low
it
gets
Drove
here
to
pick
up
tahini
paste
make
my
own
yogurt
sauce
for
shawarma
shawerma
They
had
it
it
seemed
a
little
pricey
so
I
will
have
do
some
research
compare
and
may
adjust
star
rating
accordingly
The
proprietor
was
super
nice
Seeing
as
is
attached
restaurant
shall
point
try
their
what
looked
like
fresh
baked
baklava
in
the
window

on
lookout

Love
this
place
everyone
should
try
it
The
ramen
is
very
oily
taste
average
Not
my
favourite
place
interior
decoration
was
neat
which
makes
the
dinning
experience
a
little
better
waitress
also
nice
It's
good

Ate
for
the
first
time
here
last
weekend
and
food
was
great
I
recommend
getting
one
of
complete
dinners
if
you
are
not
familiar
with
what's
good
to
order
Atmosphere
is
quiet
decor
a
little
rough
around
edges
but
place
go
casual
meal
Servers
polite
come
across
lackluster
in
their
contribution
your
dining
experience
although
that
seems
be
trend
at
most

TIP:-Best
Karak
chai
in
GTA
by
far!Didn't
try
anything
else
but
good
karak
is
rare
to
find
and
this
place
has
it
so
it's
won
my
heart!Will
review
detail
once
I
eat
here
Happy
we
finally
got
one
of
these
places
in
town
Had
Toronto
before
and
could
wait
to
try
this
place
Went
for
a
Huge
Double
Ground
Beef
Burrito
with
all
the
fixings
Turned
out
just
way
I
wanted
If
you
love
burritos
need
hurry
place
is
awesome
Electric
Lemonade
is
bigger
and
better
than
ever
This
the
only
place
in
town
where
I
regularly
buy
clothes
I'm
thrilled
that
they
opened
up
second
floor
with
even
more
vintage
awesomeness
for
me
shop
through
More
70's
band
t-shirts
please
thank
you
You
can
still
find
some
small
boutique
labels
of
modern
pieces
on
first
floor
but
new
addition
to
store
allows
you
go
crazy
looking
perfect
item
It
could
be
something
need
an
Over
Hill
t-shirt
your
birthday
or
had
no
idea
needed
80's
jacket
advertising
a
record
belonged
girl
named
Carolyn
It's
win-win
situation
adore
girls
own
it
so
happy
see
their
business
growing
If
haven't
been
get
butt
down
there
pronto
later
Reminder
not
thrift
store
don't
expect
Goodwill
prices
They
do
digging
searching
all
have
look
through
are
great
pieces
That
being
said
prices
cheaper
sweat-shop
clothes
malls
designed
vintage
Support
local
instead
yourself
real
that's
one-of-a-kind
Always
fresh
and
the
staff
is
helpful
friendly
My
husband
not
gluten
free
but
loves
everything
here
I
always
have
to
get
a
bag
of
peanut
butter
cookies
before
leave
So
nice
such
good
options
The
staff
is
extremely
friendly
and
knowledgeable
They
really
sit
listen
to
your
needs
do
their
best
work
with
you
I
would
definitely
recommend
them
Best
animal
hospital
in
Phoenix
Always
honest
and
up

about
costs
never
pushy
procedures
tests
Dr
Robbins
is
the
best
vet
has
taken
care
of
our
two
dogs
for
years

K
Higgins
are
great
too
And
don't
forget
gals
guys
at
desk
best
First
trip
to
Phoenix
Express
good
food
and
will
definitely
be
back
try
some
other
items
We
ordered
our
go
inside
was
clean
plenty
of
seating
Sushi
is
made
at
the
front
counter
so
you
can
see
ingredients
watch
it
being
made
Hot
sour
soup
egg
rolls
were
yummy
Steamed
chicken
w/veggies
comes
with
brown
sauce
that
I
order
spicy
great
did
not
like
fried
rice

wasn't
very
fried
looked
frozen
peas
carrots
too
plain
for
me
Good
California

Menu
ranges
from

Great
addition
to
downtown
Gilbert
awesome
vibe
and
excellent
service
Food
was
got
watch
the
prosciutto
being
shaved
in
front
of
us
My
only
drawback
would
be
wine
prices
With
Postino's
down
road
it
nice
not
have
order
a
glass
that
is
same
price
as
entrees
Not
lower
prices
but
maybe
larger
selection
Cheap
lunch
specials
but
the
chow
mein
for
a
dish
to
get
you
high
blood
pressure....salty
as
hell
sodium
content
in
that
must
have
been
off
roof
we
told
waiter
and
they
were
really
resistant
changing
or
making
new
one
us
so
just
settle
with
them
ate
more
noodle
which
didn't
do
squat
since
added
sauce.......we
got
their
dumplings
it
was
pricy
like
1
piece
Won't
be
coming
back
here
Bagels
are
amazing
and
as
close
to
a
real
NY
Bagel
I've
found
here
Bonus
that
they
also
have
other
favorites
like
B&W
cookies
Rainbow
Cookies
Rugula
baked
hard
find
Came
in
grab
bagels
try
out
for
my
husband
I
very
happy
with
selection
service
Staff
was
friendly
were
excellent
able
surprise
his
favorites
We
will
be
back
often
soon
miss
NYC
but
this
place
makes
some
of
the
food
cravings
more
attainable
Can't
wait
come
MIL
when
she
visits
few
weeks
breakfast
or
lunch
Our
office
orders
cheesecake
from
here
regularly
My
absolute
favorite
The
wild
blueberry
with
white
chocolate
OH
MY
GOSH
So
flavorful
and
not
too
sweet
and
pretty
to
look
at
too
You
can
much
always
expect
a
wait
on
the
weekends
but
fear
they
have
very
spacious
bar
pages
of
drinks
choose
from
Plus
you
eat
anything
here
Indian/Thai
cuisine
Italian
Americano
there
is
something
for
everyone
What
must
try
Chicken
Biscuits
an
enormous
platter
covered
in
mashed
potatoes
savory
chicken/gravy
mix
huge
biscuits
WOW
Creamy
chicken
flaky
biscuits
can't
go
wrong
Also
Picatta
my
favorite
dish-delightfully
lemony
just
right
amount
capers
tender
chicken
delicious
I've
been
to
Edwardo's
twice
now
and
its
definitely
a
good
meal
for
price
I'd
say
the
worst
thing
on
menu
is
fettuccine
alfredo
kind
of
try
pasty
but
everything
else
really
really
good
The
second
time
I
had
Surf
Turf
filet
mignon
shrimp
pasta
24.00
That
anywhere
would
have
over
30
Great
place
go
with
friends
bottle
wine
in
my
opinion
WAY
better
then
going
factory
that
l'Academie
across
street
The
best
fish
and
chips
I've
had
in
Las
Vegas
Sadly
it's
20
miles
from
my
home
but
that
doesn't
keep
me
coming
back
whenever
I
can
been
here
many
times
always
leave
satisfied
place
is
clean
the
staff
friendly
Joe
makes
sure
you
are
taken
care
of
have
whatever
need
Everything
cooked
to
order
worth
wait
majority
items
on
menu
gluten
free
if
matters
you
mean
still
deep
fried
fries
particularly
tasty
Cut
just
right
make
get
them
seasoned
These
might
be
some
fried
potatoes
area
offers
3
different
kinds

cod
haddock
catfish
all
they
terrific
Haddock
probably
favorite
usually
mix
it
up
It's
a
personal
preference
really
can't
go
wrong
here
On
Weekends
offer

A
must
try
We
came
a
Saturday
night
around
3am
and
was
super
busy
Also
went
during
day
wasn't
as
bad
wait
But
it
is
worth
it
Remind
me
of
tacos
from
TJ
Oh
Wow

SO
yummy
This
place
is
quite
packed
for
lunch
but
totally
worth
the
wait
Wonderfully
prepared
pho
with
tons
of
meaty/veggie
flavor
The
extra
basil
and
toppings
were
so
fresh
We
also
enjoyed
fresh
spring
rolls
Yum
I
cannot
wait
to
drop
in
again
Great
place
to
go
post-Christmas
Newer
clean
atmosphere
and
thanks
the
yelpers
we
ordered
firecracker
shrimp
I
loved
these
good
taste
quality
shrimp)...the
sauce
was
a
bit
much
for
my
sister...the
consistency
of
honey
walnut
prawns...which
is
not
what
she
looking
for
gladly
ate
most
them
The
garlic
noodles
while
good
also
seemed
be
cooked
with
LOT
butter
which
wasn't
ready
left
weird
heavy
after-taste
so
didn't
finish
those
We
started
fresh
spring
rolls
that
were
delicious
their
dipping
good
Wish
they
kept
siracha/other
sauces
on
table
or
brought
them
out
right
away
food
but
just
little
thing
Also
combo
rice--awesome
Totally
missed
could
have
added
an
egg
top-dang
it
Good
portion
flavor
love
accompany
it
scallion
broth
salad-a
great
touch
When
am
back
in
AZ
will
definitely
return
As
far
as
a
fun
place
to
be
this
would
it
fire
pits
grills
volleyball
cornhole
ping-pong
horseshoes
that's
all
stuff
They
have
lots
of
beer
on
tap
some
they're
out
of
I
ordered
salad
had
hair
in
that
showed
me
the
chef
wasn't
wearing
hairnet
such
bummer
to
Tell
waitress
about
she
got
another
salad
Are
friends
ribs
so
did
my
husband
they
were
cold
and
forth
if
you're
going
go
there
drink
but
food
is
nothing
special
We
moved
in
a
few
months
ago
and
the
staff
have
been
nothing
but
friendly
helpful
had
minor
things
needing
repair
maintenance
turnaround
has
less
than
24
hours
The
online
rent
payment
service
system
is
super
convenient
It
seems
that
most
of
live
here
as
well
which
my
opinion
good
thing
They
welcome
pets
too
As
far
unit
it
spacious
Upgraded
kitchen
counters
cabinets/appliances
are
gorgeous
A
large
patio
plenty
room
for
small
garden
or
play
area
kids
There
also
great
storage
on
patio
pools
always
clean
when
we
used
them
they
typically
quiet
almost
like
our
own
private
pool
landscaping
wonderfully
maintained
just
about
everyone

very
many

Las
Vegas
Take
a
taxi
Uber
or
whatever
mode
transportation
you
take
here
It
is
worth
trip
the
only
reason
Im
rating
them
a
one
is
because
they
had
of
several
pieces
duct
i
needed
man
behind
counter
was
ignorant
and
didnt
want
to
be
bothered
helping
me.then
at
end
he
tried
insulting
my
intelligence
by
making
comment
his
coworker
about
me
being
postal
employee
all
could
do
laugh
that
clown
has
no
idea
what
for
post
office
needless
say
made
own
thanks
noftz
This
place
is
fantastic
We
come
here
EVERY
week
The
potato
enchiladas
are
a
must
Their
margaritas
pretty
good
and
their
pumpkin
cookies
delicious
Great
spot
for
quick
delicious
dinner
When
this
place
first
opened
on
the
Southwest
side
I
was
stoked
There
weren't
many
Hawaiian
style
restaurants
that
knew
of
at
time
in
area
Most
places
remember
were
far
off
with
Ross
J's
Hale
closed
down
and
LnL's

closed
down
deeply
saddened
to
learn
most
authentic
know
would
disappear
Later
relieved
discover
Rice
Trax
Island
Style
best
all
Flavor
have
yet
try
out
Kauai
Grill
The
part
about
Ohana's
is
their
convenience
due
proximity
home
especially
gym
walking
distance
You
can't
go
wrong
barbeque
chicken
plates
are
pretty
generous
Lately
dishes
been
getting
skimpy
these
days
now
they
incorporating
a
grip
Chinese
believe
owners
likey...Chinese
One
thing
be
aware
if
you
used
traditional
Japanese
curry
just
katsu
curry
incorporates
more
coconut
based
thai-style
not
my
favorite
But
BBQ
always
hit
fish
ain't
half
bad
do
like
mac
salad
probably
because
its
creamy
heavy
mayo
am
fan
dryer

Mixing
matching

need
quick
lau
or
kalua
pork

can
curb
your
craving
without

for
what
got
Loco

So

Staff

Okay

redundant
stretching

all
Nice
place
very
clean
today's
visit

I
had
Kefta
Kebab
Plate

included
two
large
Kebabs

lots
of
flavorful
rice
salad

plenty
feta
great
dressing
can't
determine
type
or
what
spices
it
contained
but
dressing
good
First
off
the
place
has
an
original
soda
jerk
counter
awesome
They
make
all
of
their
own
ice
cream
and
some
it
is
pretty
inventive
I
got
Ho-Ho
Supreme
You
heard
me
right
vanilla
cream
with
a
fudge
swirl
and
you
guessed
it
actual
Ho-Hos
A
fat
kid's
dream
The
hubs

Grasshopper
think
cookies
only
mint
cream
highly
recommend
getting
waffle
cone
bowl
as
well
This
CASH
ONLY
which
judging
by
quality
they
can
totally
afford
to
do
Prices
were
completely
reasonable
Parking
was
ample
Place
not
crowded
Completely
spick
n
span
Friendly
quick
staff
Can't

They

IF
YOU'RE
LOOKING
TO
BE
DISRESPECTED
IN
FRONT
OF
YOUR
FRIENDS
THIS
IS
THE
PLACE
BE
Very
bad
service
The
manager
there
seems
to
let
her
employees
treat
customers
however
they
want
Rushing
us
and
speaking
in
their
own
language
the
entire
time
did
not
make
feel
at
ease
We
finally
decided
leave
asked
for
a
refund
since
no
service
was
given
One
of
had
an
attitude
then
when
given
she
tossed
my
money
back
me
told
store
will
never
go
that
place
again
we
recommend
anyone
else
either
TRUST
ME
I
had
eaten
here
twice
love
the
food
Everything
was
great
The
only
thing
would
change
to
have
an
on
line
menu
Also
called
and
they
are
out
of
a
lot
items
sometimes
My
waitress
very
friendly
think
this
place
is

Errrrrrrbody

I
hit
up
the
distillery

so
thank

fell
in
love
We
went
intentions
grabbing
wings
a
ever
famous
vanilla

They
unfortunately
poured
last
porter
when

for
round
cobblestone
stout
start
Both
were
phenom
haven't
dabbled
much
into
world
bitter
beers
But
did
seem
enjoy
this
particular
brew

aftertaste

The
hot
good
Even
them
just
touch
too
hot
how
like
them
bbq
ones
pretty
tasty
as
well
Lots
meat

My
boyfriend

he
raved
about
entire
trip
nibble
yelp-age
sake
can
agree
portobello
sandwich
couldn't
resist
even
slightest
amount
goat
cheese
favorite
part
actually
fries
Crispy
golden
what
appeared
sea
salt
itself
yummy
but
felt
more
cheese
needed
less
portobello
All
awesome
meal
Not
mention
unbelievable
atmosphere
Very
neat
inside
working
fireplace
This
our

This

The
combination
heat
from
juiciness
chicken
plus
was
outstanding
only
problem
with
this
restaurant
having
to
choose
or
two
items
There
are
so
many
things
on
menu
that
sound
just
as
good
I'll
definitely
be
back
try
more
them
One
item
note
there's
seating
entire
place
for
roughly
12
people
plan
accordingly
all
packed
take-out
if
you
can't
find
a
seat
you're
still
good
shape
No
reviews
for
McCall's
The
baking
professionals
since
1956
I
mean
know
it's
out
in
Etobicoke
but
the
obsessed
home
baker
ie
myself
this
place
is
definitely
worth
trek
finally
went
to
McCall's
other
day
with
a
friend
and
had
hold
back
not
spending
all
money
my
wallet
Not
that
things
supply
heaven
are
expensive
just
you
end
up
wanting
buy
every
single
type
of
themed
cupcake
liners
several
colours
coloured
sugars
different
shades
gel-paste
food
colour
so
on
as
walk
through
aisle
shop
fortunately
there
only
about
half
dozen
aisles
There
was
quite
good
variety
items
available
when
there
although
some
areas
seemed
somewhat
picked
over
especially
seasonal
items
be
sure
visit
well
advance
your
holiday-themed
ventures
In
addition
these
decorating-related
can
also
purchase
kinds
pans
trays
carrying
cases
utensils
etc
But
none
nearly
fun
pretty
stuff
obviously
Also
note
offers
wide
cake
decorating
courses
throughout
year
newbies
experts
alike
Unfortunately
their
website
horribly
maintained
you'll
likely
have
no
luck
properly
seeing
course
schedule
online
they
do
free
booklet
store
information
need
or
could
always
give
them
call
I
had
no
idea
they
served
Cantonese
style
dim
sum
from
the
name
of
restaurant
but
was
introduced
to
it
when
yelping
for
in
Scarborough
From
1:30-3:30pm
is
1.68
which
go
find
myself
coming
here
every
time
I'm
craving
some
quick
cheap
sum
They
have
a
relatively
decent
selection

although
not
as
extensive
restaurants
But
price
you
pay
this
place
can't
be
beat
like
how
food
comes
out
piping
hot
each
and
don't
charge
table
cloth
tea
only
80
cents
however
many
people
have
Most
locations
I've
been
fee
1
per
person
also
serve
Szechuan
dishes
noodles
rice
snacks
those
wanting
little
more
variety
plus
One
star
off
because
quality
could
better
really
complain
right
Overall
would
highly
recommend
afternoon
Went
here
for
a
conference
The
room
was
terrible
food
average
at
best
and
the
staff
pretty
rude
overall
Good
luck
This
church
is
filled
with
the
Holy
Spirit
Love
VBF
Bakersfield
Nonetheless
Vegas
AMAZING
as
well
My
experience
and
only
about
alterations
Needed
a
dress
sleeve
to
be
fixed
came
in
the
guy
barely
looked
said
it
could
not
fixed
What
Oh
ok
Went
home
did
myself
of
course
took
me
bit
longer
but
I
it
Won't
go
back
for
alterations
Maybe
dry
cleaning
Incredibly
professional
knowledgeable
fair
and
customer
service
oriented
I
love
Dad's
The
staff
is
super
friendly
the
food
always
good
and
a
bonus
they
have
outdoor
seating
where
your
pups
can
accompany
you
Good
atmosphere
and
architecture
Weisen
beer
was
good
although
bottled
Had
every
appetizer
last
night
for
a
work
party
one
bad
Beer
cheese
pretzel
had

I
didn't
know
better
cheez

All
they
sale
is
chicken
That's
saying
can
concentrate
on
making
it
the
same
everytime
I've
not
been
disappointed
Good
eats
I
love
this
hotel
Miracle
mile
of
shopping
Must

Such
wonderful

The
only

that
the
would
have
benefited
from
couple
more
crisps
Thai
House
was
my
favorite
restaurant
in
Charlotte
Their
food
is
fresh
spiced
to
order
and
delicious
Portions
are
huge
so
I
always
had
leftovers
for
lunch
the
next
day
Try
spring
rolls
delicious
The
decor
beautiful
waitstaff
wear
traditional
dress
They
friendly
attentive
enjoyed
meals
here
occasionally
offer
promotions
area
which
a
great
way
save
some
money
also
have
weekend
menu
that
features
of
their
classics
at
price
would
recommend
house
anyone
who
loves
Thai
or
those
want
try
I
have
been
looking
to
try
a
chicken
and
waffles
place
that's
out
of
the
norm
I've
found
couple
but
was
for
something
specifically
in
Vegas
as
going
be
on
vacation
there
bruxie
one
many
extensive
searches
do
intrigued
They
were
not
only
waffles
they
sandwiches
Totally
got
me
And
good
reason
holy
chicken
when
you
bite
into
it
name
makes
all
more
sense
It's
perfect
combination
sweet
savory
every
single
bite
also
waffle
fries
strawberry
lemonade
everything
just
seemed
pair
so
well
heaven
As
service
crowd
went
at
fairly
quiet
time
around
2
or
3
towards
beginning
strip
don't
get
that
crazy
crowd
GO
TREAT
YOURSELF
I've
been
here
three
times
already
and
the
customer
service
is
slightly
below
average
this
just
based
on
receptionists

through
phone
in
person
I
guess
it
depends
their
mood
but
both
gotten
them
with
a
slight
attitude
However
person
who
did
my
waxing
Korine
was
great
she's
basically
straight
to
point
minimal
conversation
out
Nothing
nice
to
say
about
this
store
honestly
My
mother

I
love
interior
stores
so
before
heading
into
Trader
Joe's
we
decided
check
it
out
Two
women
were
on
duty
talking
the
entire
time
Walked
in
no
greeting
To
give
them
benefit
of
doubt
walked
right
past
both
while
looking
at
them
nothing
It
was
like
literally
did
not
exist
No
acknowledgement
Just
talk
each
other
because
their
conversation
obviously
more
important
then
making
a
sale
or
even
noticing
that
someone
in
small
shop
The
way
they
ignoring
us
open
obvious
really
rubbed
wrong
way
Well
around
store
Looked
around
Ladies
Honestly
nothing
there
for
us
over
priced
things
one
actually
needs
taste
wise
anything
you
can't
get
somewhere
with
better
service
You
can
tell
is
aiming
luxury
but
feel
luxurious
requires
level
class

by
mean
good
manners
well
meaning
attitude
from
people
running
This
does
offer
all
Do
not
bring
your
business
here
Where
do
I
even
begin
have
spent
the
last
30
minutes
calling
them
and
phone
just
rings
rings
can
understand
if
you
are
busy
but
at
least
acknowledge
call
That
is
extremely
frustrating
Secondly
my
family
had
a
wedding
anniversary
this
past
weekend
let
me
explain
what
happened
with
tuxedos
My
dads
pants
were
wrong
size
uncles
button
on
vest
broken
another
altered
to
short
boyfriend
was
missing
his
suspenders
We
did
our
more
importantly
spend
money
getting
ripped
off
This
for
event
didn't
mention
horrible
attitude
we
received
while
one
of
guys
got
fitted
or
how
they
gave
nephew
whole
2
sizes
too
big
then
begin
tell
us
it
basically
fault
will
never
come
back
Nice
contemporary
Mexican
place

fun
to
catch
up
with
a
friend
or
grab
bite
eat

Try
shrimp
ceviche
pork
carnitas
very
good
The
management
takes
good
care
of
the
and
customers
Convenient
location
in
heart
green
valley
Networking
mixers
are
always
there
as
well
Another
update
so
recently
after
my
last
one
that's
because
son
and
I
love
this
place
we
can't
have
a
holiday
break
without
coming
here
to
bite
eat
say
hello
everyone
that
works
there
This
time
was
happy
see
there
were
plenty
of
LARGE
groups
in
during
lunch
parties
10
or
more
is
something
I've
never
written
about
previous
reviews
They
large
section
by
the
side
where
they
can
accommodate
groups
thirty
more
if
needed
desired
There's
also
an
enclosed
patio
area
I'm
not
sure
it's
conditioned
you
wanted
birthday
party
group
for
private
room
feel
as
it
spacious
has
its
own
door
entrances
And
fantastic
them
crowded
usual
lunch

This

my
new
favorite
coffee
shop
A

silverware
Are

trying
to
make
this
a
to-go
place
or

Pretty

taking
care
of
me
when
go
The
food
great
my
experience
there
amazing
makes
it
joy
to
want
come
back
We
found
this
place
on
yelp
and
it
completely
lives
up
to
the
positive
reviews
Burgers
fries
shakes
were
delicious
The
staff
is
friendly
helpful
I
highly
recommend
Lucky's

He

Overall
very
enjoyable

On
a
bride's
wedding

the

bride

Thank
you
the
ER
staff
that
took
my
worries
seriously

3
visits
to
St
Rose
pediatrics
with
17
month
old
3
different
doctors
said
he
is
fine
and
just
teething
It's
happens
be
pneumonia
After
few
tests
exray
we
were
prescribed
antibiotics
doing
better
It
was
a
good
experience
clean
everybody
very
human
kind
which
actually
surprised
me
because
I
feel
like
no
one
cares
for
your
child
except
you
not
at
this
place
they
genuinely
do
care
try
help

This
is
an
update
to
my
previous
review
Someone
from
first
impressions
finally
came
out
address
the
quality
issues
with
security
door
The
technician
touched
up
paint
satisfaction
but
did
nothing
poor
welding
Apparently
irregular
welds
are
a
hallmark
of
custom
made
doors
If
you
want
uniform
aesthetically
pleasing
need
buy
cheaper
mass
produced
door
one
big
box
home
improvement
retailers
Also
after
was
finished
he
just
left
without
telling
me
what
or
if
I
satisfied
thought
went
get
some
supplies
took
off
Strange
way
ensure
customer
satisfaction
The
giant
hamster
balls
were
a
huge
hit
dodge
ball
and
climbing
wall
as
popular
ever
Red
Robin
had
the
best
salads
They
used
to
be
huge
where
you
could
only
finish
half
and
take
rest
home
not
anymore
Salads
are
size
2.00
more
in
price
Very
disappointing
Got
a
draft
made
big
mistake
by
asking
for
price
list
I
almost
choked
when
saw
my
bill
was
charged
7.50
beer
never
again
Sure
this
review
is
from
a
very
blurry
2:00
a.m
need
of
food
on
the
strip
But
come
to
think
it
that
most
my
reviews
Vegas
I
have
here
everytime
go
never
had
bad
burger
or
fries
Yes
It's
little
more
pricey
then
typical
chain
joints
when
in
24
hour
Fat
Burger
worth
it
loved
add
outdoor
seating
area/bar
will
be
back
again
for
sure
And
as
of
today
these
crooks
haven't
returned
my
100
deposit
for
the

They
said
it
would
be
same
day
check
out
and
it's
been
two
days
I
traded
in
my
vehicle
for
a
certified
pre-owned
truck
that
had
issues
should
have
been
addressed
during
the
hundred-something
point
inspection
they
bragged
about
The
alignment
was
way
off
tires
were
out
of
balance
and
brakes
squealed
pulsated
noticed
these
things
on
test
drive
salesman
told
me
it
would
be
taken
care
after
sale
no
problem
Also

to
what
looks

minor

He

When

some
paint/interior

this

run
around
why

They

After

Came
in
again
Waited
a
few
minutes
for
seating
Waitress
said
she

I
was
ordering

delivered
regular
nigiri
roll
Food
is
good
here
Service
not
so
much
Aaron
would
approve
sure
endured
It's
Vegas
and
when
a
group
of
four
tipsy
20-something
year
olds
come
stammering
into
restaurant
at
4
in
the
morning
who
are
expected
to
be
fed
you
know
that
they
expecting
nothing
but
accommodating
food
satisfy
them
First
off
let
me
mention
there
is
an
all
can
eat
KBBQ
here
while
I
did
not
choose
this
route
will
provide
some
evident
opinions
from
my
fellow
party-doers
Their
beef
pretty
fresh
might
recommend
tongue
sounds
gross
it's
so
good
anywhere
take
word
for
it
We
came
like
said
crack
dawn
it
was
busy
we
were
actually
only
one
two
What
liked
about
place
where
grill
meat
buttered
up
get
grungy
charred
up
don't
think
waitress
had
change
all
Overall
isn't
something
out
world
most
friends
decent
Secondly
us
move
onto
meal
am
soup
connoisseur
so
quite
naturally
bought
noodle
honestly
wish
could
remember
name
literally
just
got
done
with
clubbing
putting
stomach
warm
bowl
delicious
spicy
soup
sure
find
if
muster
enough
creativity
review
The
thing
wanted
us
three
AYCE
went

entree
exclaimed
NO
SHARING
OKAY
Which
kind
irked
because
type
loopholes
eat
So
going
dock
point
off
that
Harsh

ego
damaged
She
proceeds
ask
help
finish
all
have
tables
turned
should
definitely
try
Kimchi
truly
insatiable
hunger
yours
any
time
day
Just
watch
out
or
can't
share
All-around
excellent
experience
Tender
filet
all
food
served
at
perfect
temperatures
great
prompt
service
even
on
a
busy
night
These
folks
seem
to
have
their
act
well
together
wow
so
all
of
the
previous
reviews
were
right
on
mark
I
wish
would've
been
able
to
read
them
before
i
took
my
child
see
Dr
Dickinson
She
is
rude
and
her
front
staff
Originally
they
could
not
do
anything
or
answer
any
questions
without
talking
first
That
was
first
red
flag
told
extremely
afraid
needles
asked
if
we
give
daughter
nasal
spray
for
flu
vaccine
rather
than
shot.....I
let
convince
me
try
it
would
be
ok....it
ok
she
pretty
much
held
down
gave
her
still
continued
stay
there
thinking
Dickinson
militant
but
really
that's
correct
word
She's
mean
tries
talk
way
above
your
head
you'll
walk
out
thinking...what
just
happened
So
anyways
finally
decided
switch
when
messed
up
daughter's
prescription
twice
They
both
written
wrong
increased
dosage
clearly
discussed
leaving
same
til
gained
more
weight
It's
a
hyperactivity
Not
something
you
want
play
around
with
called
later
about
medical
records
being
transferred
over
lady
sighed
into
phone
loud
as
say
didn't
bothered
I'm
done
with
that
place
Don't
take
please
go
somewhere
else
attempted
transfer
children
Providence
Pediatrics
Ballantyne
I'll
leave
review
there.....good
luck
that
What
ever
happened
good
customer
service
i'm
asking
complicated
The
staff
here
are
always
friendly
and
good
at
what
they
do
Today
the
cafe
had
only
one
working
espresso
machine
walk-in
customers
mobile
orders
were
a
dozen
deep
but
team
was
handling
it
all
with
genuine
class
To
crew
this
cafe
you're
doing
great
job
A
new
Homestead
favorite
We
made
a
reservation
but
decided
on
different
movie
and
showed
up
early
to
make
that
work
They
were
friendly
accommodating
seating
us
right
away
adjusting
an
errant
spotlight
was
pointed
at
my
head
Service
great
all
the
way
through
Drinks
came
promptly
she
offered
samples
as
needed
She
even
around
asked
if
we
wanted
another
round
before
happy
hour
ended
Food
well
though
I'd
definitely
have
ordered
differently
know
how
big
portions
were
started
with
mozzarella
stuffed
meatballs
good
their
own
side
of
sauce
really
finished
dish

could
used
bit
more
that
The
boyfriend
meatloaf
loved
it

reduced
French

followed
closely
by
jalapeno

well
brussels
very
good
little
pricey
for
Homestead
food
service
stood
up
so
didn't
deduct
star
I
came
here
with
a
friend
little
while
ago
because
we
were
both
in
the
mood
for
Mexican
food
and
it
was
warm
sunny
day
this
restaurant
had
patio
We
seated
on
patio
waiter
promptly
back
bowl
of
nachos
some
salsa
The
an
unpleasant
somewhat
bitter
taste
to
them
salsa
watery
bland
decided
split
tasting
platter
which
included
chicken
enchilada
beef
burrito

choice
quesadilla
or
tamalito
side
went
quesadilla
Our
took
unusually
long
time
arrive
I'd
say
at
least
good
half
hour
Everything
bland
soggy
you're
better
off
going
Taco
Bell
than
his
place
I
only
come
here
when
need
to
grab
something
quick
They
don't
have
the
variety
some
of
others
have
Its
annoying
that
they
force
you
walk
right
around
fruit
and
vegetable
section
just
crab
The
cooked
chickens
are
small
double
price
than
COSTCO
wine
is
different
one
on
west
side
Actually
its
better
here
I
really
wish
could
give
this
place
0
stars
Prior
to
today
I've
been
here
about
three
times
and
the
food
was
decent
but
service
always
mediocre
But
definitely
takes
cake
for
shit
service
We
walked
in
sat
ourselves
then
8
minutes
later
someone
brings
us
a
menu....I
should
mention
that
it's
hot
as
hell
in
feels
like
their
AC
broke...so
we
look
at
Menu
are
waiting
them
take
our
drink
orders
no
TWO
servers
they
have
just
keep
walking
by
The
table
next
there
before
didn't
even
drinks
so
knew
it
going
be
awhile
Another
10
go
by
nothing
Worst
ever
get
up
walk
out
Do
not
come
unless
you
want
sweating
while
you're
eating
mediocre
I
usually
love
brew
pubs

good
craft
beer
and
bar-type
food
suits
me
pretty
good.....but....this
place
was
a
sub-par
experience
for
my
first
time
being
there
ordered
bleu
cheese/onion
burger
maybe
named
Bluestone
sweet
potato
fries
decent
tasty
meal
what
you'd
expect
fries
can't
remember
boyfriend
his
sandwich
but
he
side
of
cheese
curds
I've
NEVER
seen
curds
SO
SMALL
It
embarrassing
the
cost
paltry
amount
waaay
too
high
When
we
asked
waiter
about
curds
looked
embarrassed
went
back
to
kitchen
brought
out
similarly
small
serving
curds
Yikes
Not
impressed
We
had
waitress
that
never
really
offered
get
us
another
or
water
frustrating
too
The
tasty
Update
happy
report
owner
reached
immediately
i
will
be
giving
this
try
We
weren't
given
a
receipt
or
our
cups
The
cashier
who
was
clearly
new
did
bring
us
cups
after
we
were
seated
I
waited
by
the
register
because
needed
water
cup
so
happened
to
be
there
when
order
came
up
noticed
one
of
my
cheeseburgers
missing
looked
at
receipt
which
on
tray
with
food
cashier
rang
up
both
meals
as
individual
items
shorting
me
cheeseburger
and
charging
48
more
After
avoiding
gaze
for
some
time
finally
asked
if
problem
explained
it
her
she
grabbed
manager
didn't
understand
what
saying
immediately
understood
said
would
fix
it
She
very
patronizingly
that
insulting
then
proceeded
put
in
an
second
cheeseburger
overcharged
items
being
rung
individually
told
had
walked
away
overcharged
interrupted
it
yelled
her
overcharged
ignored
me
no
idea
going
on
like
deer
headlights
just
off
huff
messed
another
order

No
Went
for
lunch
on
1-31-16
with
four
others
and
we
all
selected
our
choices
The
server
was
warm
friendly
despite
the
place
being
very
busy
We
loved
meals
food
served
hot
tasty
ample
quantity
plated
beautifully
Love
will
certainly
return
owner/cook
greeted
us
after
had
eaten
asked
how
enjoyed
Very
nice
touch
This
chicken
is
so
good

I
got
the
4
piece
to
share
between
2
people
and
it
was
enough
especially
if
you've
been
drinking
Then
next
day
with
extra
wing
added
It
great
Come
fries
coleslaw
which
very
tart
not
good
Bf

said

They
have
a
spicy
honey

Over

Can't
wait

back
Vegas

Staff
super
friendly
There's
red
head
girl
she
some
helpful
nice

3
stars
is
being
nice
just
because
the
server
was
so
sweet
The
food
sub
par
and
not
very
exciting
Tried
guacamole
far
too
much
cilantro
pad
Thai
spicy
super
bland
Moscow
Mule
from
bar
best
part
Best
place
in
town
to
get
your
lashes
done
They
are
very
accommodating
The
décor
is
super
cute
it's
so
relaxing
and
the
staff
phenomenal
set
of
ever
thank
you
for
my
Laci
You
know
how
you
see
in
movies
the
really
chill
relationship
that
a
barber
has
with
his
clients
That's
what
this
place
feels
like
Scott
is
good
and
an
all
around
guy
whose
just
fun
to
talk
to
Cheap
haircut
makes
for
experience
I'll
be
going
here
next
3
years
Excellent
professional
service
Josephine
actually
listened
to
me
and
helped
with
a
tight
budget
this
was
my
first
time
buying
progressives
after
trying
cheaper
ones
from
an
online
dealer
I
saw
they
were
horrible
So
returned
them
for
little
bit
more
money
got
glasses
that
work
always
returns
your
calls
done
in
good
time
will
refer
her
all
friends
This
was
an
incredible
show
although
a
little
too
short
That's
the
only
negative
thing
about
it
beautiful
man
Frédéric
Da
Silva
truly
has
gift
of
spirit
and
extreme
open-mindedness
which
enables
him
to
do
things
he
does
It
giant
pleasure
watch
his
awesome
magic
I
got
be
small
part
it
blew
my
mind
BIG
TIME
as
also
did
everyone
else's
show
is
not
expensive
at
all
so
if
you
just
ONE
while
in
Vegas
take
hour
or
so
plan
on
going
see
this
amazing
that
will
definitely
stay
with
you
You'll
telling
your
friends
well
One
more
thing
Ladies
man
SUPER-GORGEOUS

Carol
W
Denver
CO
With
my
goyish
taste
buds
I
can
still
appreciate
their
delicious
matzo
ball
soup
and
turkey
pastrami
Good
food
honesty
are
part
of
the
charm
for
this
eastern
suburban
deli
spot
say
because
when
you
ask
waitress
how
she
is
doing
don't
expect
to
hear
All
right
guess
shlepping
here
making
a
living
Following
that
if
dare
how's
your
reuben
you'd
almost
best
sandwiches
in
town
there
good
argument
be
made
that
I
fly
out
of
Pierre
Elliott
Trudeau
whenever
to
my
destination
and
for
the
most
part
don't
have
any
issues
I've
gone
Canada
Customs
register
some
products
travel
they
were
helpful
When
do
pre-clearance
US
check
at
PET
Airport
which
is
somewhat
rare
because
generally
a
stopover
in
Toronto
or
Vancouver
when
US
There
city
bus
that
services
this
which
makes
to/from
airport
easy
depending
on
location
The
WiFi
free
charge
luggage
carts
like
airports
been
do
would
give
4
stars
I
looked
up
reviews
prior
to
going
The
bar
was
set
high
and
boy
did
this
place
exceed
my
expectations
It
close
closing
time
but
he
still
took
the
look
at
car
basically
explain
how
a
worked
will
definitely
return
for
any
future
needs
Thumbs
up
Awesome
awesome
show
Obviously
if
you're
a
fan
of
Michael
Jackson
and
you
know
all
his
hit
songs
dance
moves
will
enjoy
every
single
second
The
Cirque
influence
is
subtle

this
show
more
about
the
music
dancing
less
any
circus
stuff
down
Nothing
really
negative
to
say
Yes
prices
are
sky
high
more
so
than
other
shows
in
Vegas
need
book
far
advance
get
your
desired
date
seats
Tip
If
can
splurge
for
seats
middle
center
section
That's
sweet
spot
We've
been
looking
at
the
new
Subaru
Outbacks
and
Foresters
online
in
order
to
determine
which
will
best
serve
our
needs
We
drove
Bowser
today
compare
two
models
person
The
visit
turned
out
be
rather
strange
arrived
approximately
12:15
PM
I
don't
recall
seeing
any
other
customers
on
outdoor
lot
that
time
looked
cars
outdoors
for
a
while
during
time
we
saw
three
persons
walk
by
appeared
employees
went
inside
showroom
about
more
people
behind
or
near
front
desk
proceeded
left
side
of
an
Outback
Forester
quite
while
noticed
few
adjacent
offices
those
cars
strange
part
was
no
one
ever
made
attempt
speak
us

hello
smile
acknowledgement
presence
appreciate
low
pressure
sales
techniques
but
felt
like
Bruce
Willis
Sixth
Sense
today
This
is
surely
anomaly
would
sold
In
end
trip
not
wasted
as
what
needed
see
Julian
Serrano
was
one
of
the
culinary
hot
spots
when
it
first
opened
The
new
car
smell
might
be
gone
after
a
few
years
now
but
quality
remains
many
items
we
ordered
were
quite
good
bacon
wrapped
dates
stood
out
for
me
with
good
balance
sweetness
and
saltiness
Even
though
it's
still
not
as
from
AVEC
in
Chicago
I
can
appreciate
execution
scallop
disappointing
dish
taste
wasn't
bad
price
to
ratio
seriously
lacking
lonely
scallop
definitely
felt
lighter
wallet
this
dish
paying
premium
restaurant
on
strip
is
expected
tuna
cone
almost
there
super
thin
won
ton
didn't
belong
thicker
crunchier
skin
more
suitable
If
you
are
into
tapa
style
place
worth
your
consideration
I'm
reluctant
to
write
this
review
as
I
contacted
the
owners
last
week
via
email
about
recent
problems
with
delivery
My
complaints
were
not
addressed
Saying
this
Mandy's
is
an
establishment
that
offers
a
variety
of
GF
and
allergen
free
foods
The
problem
being
one
only
establishments
does
they
can
skimp
on
quality
customer
service
customers
will
continue
order
because
other
options
are
scarce
Dominos
please
Anyways
am
ordered
regularly
from
no
problem
However
three
times
my
food
took
at
least
2
hours
arrive
after
ordering
always
showed
up
cold
old
had
call
each
time
check
it
was
offered
apologies
but
refunds
or
delivery
fees
waived
reached
out
their
website
concerns
In
ALL
honesty
in
amount
it
takes
for
product
show
door
could
go

buy
ingredients
make
pizza

If
do

to
several
alleys

this
one
has
things
others
lack
I
like
that
bar
surrounded
with
tvs/projectors
it's
clean
looking
The
alley
general
seems
pretty
clean
bathrooms
spelled
bleach
were
well
kept
That's
a
good
quality
have
take
daughter
there
change
her
at
least
once
or
twice
during
visit
here
lane
conditions
are
kept
electronics
upgraded
reason
why
four
star
instead
of
five
they
don't
pro
shop
just
find
completely
odd
especially
since
hold
tournaments
Also
had
bad
experience
grill
whatever
you
want
call
it
would
not
recommend
eating
due
poor
customer
service
If
ever
an
issue
make
sure
notify
manager
Overall
nice
alley
a
coworker
of
mine
recommended
that
i
check
out
l'albatros
years
ago
finally
got
the
chance
last
week
and
here's
what
felt
about
it
parking/directions/area
knew
it
was
in
university
circle
area
near
case
western
severance
hall
my
date
did
not
park
lot
rather
we
circled
around
until
finding
space
3
minutes
walking

mind
you
this
830
9pm
on
thursday
night
environment/decor/atmosphere
tend
to
look
at
restaurant's
interior
design
more
so
than
others
one
first
things
noticed
contemporary
feel
w
brick

lovely
subdued

great
for

oddly
enough
mentioned
winter-time

be
fantastic
view

however

my
had
an

banal
even
also

tight
door
too
close
stall

food/servers
our
servers
were
nice
informative
gave
us
time
select
choices
without
feeling
rushed
nothing
bad
say
level
food-wise
arugula
salad
is
VERY
GOOD
flavorful
wonderful
precursor
entree
eye
hanger
steak
but
opted
salmon
lentils
honestly
ive
better
salmon
bad
expecting
bit
flavor
other
half
some
type
shrimp
bisque
combination
which
very
tasty
forget
name
as
its
entree
special
such
may
menu
much
longer
overall
pleased
environment
service...but
next
ill
pick
another
plate
hopefully
opinion
food
will
better
yes
they
are
everywhere
in
the
south
I
like
it
that
you
can
go
into
a
store
Va
and
it's
laid
out
same
as
one
Carolina
i
must
say
for
the
price
you
pay
should
have
first
class
service
this

to
be

I
seats

hope
dont
get
lost
going
your
because
no
one
was
helpful
and
if
find
someone
that
may
answers
they
just
point
in
direction
very
unfriendly
I
checked
out

Overall
good
experience
My
parents
have
been
raving
about
this
place
for
a
while
so
I
decided
to
try
it
boyfriend
absolutely
loved
his
meat
lovers
pizza
he
had
bacon
sausage
pepperoni
and
ham
i
think
on
there
sampled
few
peices
of
the
sausage
it
very
clean
savory
flavor
not
like
greasy
clumps
junk
other
places
put
pizza
salad
since
slight
gluten
sensitivity
The
only
reason
gave
4
stars
instead
5
was
selling
Udi's
Gluten
Free
pizza
dough
I'm
sure
if
anyone
who
works
there
has
ever
actually
tried
product
but
times
taste
is
horrible
hoping
they'd
offer
something
else
maybe
eventually
they
will
good
enjoyed
lemon
oil
dressing
which
light
refreshing
think
should
allow
as

I'll

This
is
my
go-to
spot
for
sushi
in
Arizona
Being
a
native
Californian
Asian
American
and
mild
snob
I
have
to
say
that
the
all-you-can
eat
here
best
bang
your
buck
I've
seen
For
20
Cali
you
might
be
able
gain
entry
into
one
of
those
AYCE
seafood
buffets
where
freshness
fish
sacrificed
name
variety
But
at
Mido
it's
all
about
fish
mean
when
I'm
feeling
ambitious
I'll
enjoy
their
crispy
tempura
basket
beforehand
And
wouldn't
miss
Japanese
red
bean/green
tea/mango
ice
cream
end
real
star
show
nigiri
The
quality

can
waver
from
visit
visit
but
even
on
bad
day
pretty
good
tend
like
salmon
hamachi
yellowtail
white
toro
fatty
tuna
best
Their
rolls
are
good
too
never
bring
myself
order
them
Maybe
because
hear
Chinese
father's
voice
head
telling
me
shovel
as
much
expensive
stuff
stomach
can
Still
fresh
memory
Sunday
night
our
whole
party
could've
sworn
they
had
just
flown
Japan
delivered
it
straight
table
Rich
melt-in-your-mouth
goodness
that's
only
ever
been
topped
by
days
going
Sasabune
LA
with
sugar
daddy/foodie
friend
Fun
sweet
chefs
too
One
time

What
can
I
say
about
Art
of
Flavors
that
hasn't
already
been
said
The
gelato
is
amazing
When
trying
to
decide
on
a
flavor
you
can't
resist
as
many
the
offerings
possible
They're
irresistable
have
admit
prefer
some
more
unusual
flavors
so
that's
huge
selling
point
me
I'm
disappointed
in
myself
for
taking
long
did
give
them
chance
I'll
be
back
and
often
Luckily
they
also
offer
AOF
at
Novecento
across
town
if
need
get
my
fix.I
love
it
when
local
restaurants
work
together
I
first
visited
lupo
a
while
back
when
Mandalay
bay
opened
The
place
was
usually
solid
reliable
with
good
service

as
would
expect
from
an
establishment
that
has
Wolfgang
puck's
name
on
have
since
then
every
time
we
Vegas
But
it
seems
lately
puck
does
not
stand
for
much
anymore
We
arrived
reservation
on
the
allotted
6pm
host
seemed
little
overwhelmed
even
though
were
only
ones
he
had
to
seat
at
time
One
of
waiters
came
over
and
took
us
our
table
He
told
be
getting
menus
in
minute
left
turns
out
wasn't
waiter
15
minutes
later
finally
got
after
manager
noticed
didn't
any
Our
waiter
Devin
showed
up
drink
order
And
another
long
wait
At
point
ready
leave
but
decided
based
previous
experience
stay
ordered
entrees
pizza
fettuccine
Alfredo
mushroom
pasta
When
food
reached
table
asked
Parmesan
cheese
After
5
final
straw
simply
refill
my
coke
realized
completely
forgot
about
it
called
refill
She
very
prompt
right
away
saving
grace
place
this
poor
visit
again
considering
all
other
available
culinary
choices
A
value
if
you
decent
service
I
went
to
phoenix
visit
friends
and
they
highly
recommended
this
restaurant
for
authentic
mexican
food
We
there
lunch
took
a
look
at
what
other
people
were
eating
as
we
getting
our
table
it
looked
interesting
had
the
fish
tacos
baja
style
very
good
also
sarandeado
fillet
was
delicious.I
liked
cebada
drink
service
good
staff
friendly
even
though
fairly
busy
too
bad
in
just
couple
of
days
Just
spend
20
minutes
in
the
drive
thru
they
were
out
of
munchkins
I
wanted
and
dozen
donuts
are
got
stale
don't
even
look
good
Waste

time
Won't
be
coming
back
here
5

the
experience

them
and
hit
the
same
day
pick
up
option
It
showed
me
several
stores
at
which
could
up
chose
this
one
My
time
was
7:15
pm
told
by
gentleman
who
works
department
that
they
were
unable
to
make
these
because
out
of
ink
Why
didn't
call
when
received
order
don't
know
But
Christmas
presents
needed
tonight
asked
what
do
said
calling
around
get
ink
from
another
store
The
manager
then
would
need
drive
if
wanted
done
tonight
as
his
staff
have
cars
i
just
a
few
miles
down
road
retrieved
came
back
Keep
in
mind
already
transfer
my
couldn't
handed
he
it
wrong
kind
At
point
I'm
pissed
but
all
care
about
is
getting
books
He
unfortunately
there
wasn't
anything
refund
money
Which
want
ordered
Before
giving
running
with
money
called
online

be
ready
truly
will
mistake
won't
again
Good
res
grill

pretty
good
must
try
their
chicken
wings
This
is
relatively
new
store
Have
been
to
several
other
Firehouse
Subs
so
we
knew
what
expect
My
wife
had
the
hook
and
ladder
lite
I
steak

They
were
both
very
good
It
was
kind
of
funny
that
menu
how
order
better
than
clerk
did
busy
but
they
pretty
quick
on
getting
our
food
We
will
be
back
as
this
closer
one
near
us
Amazing
The
food
was
delicious
the
service
outstanding
and
ambience
lovely
Went
for
brunch
so
glad
I
did
Our
large
table
of
8
treated
extremely
well
we
all
loved
our
food
Very
much
place
Toronto
missing
special

Would
love
to

spa
7
Day
Spa
and
Nails
is
conveniently
located
in
Tempe
Marketplace
so
you
can
get
your
nails
did
before
shopping
You
do
not
need
an
appointment
I
have
never
waited
for
a
technician
to
seat
me
start
working
The
spa
itself
very
nicely
decorated
relaxing
like
mani/pedi
because
it
makes
feel
super
pampered
really
wish
they
had
customer
loyalty
program
give
incentives
those
who
their
done
every
month
it
was
fresh
had
some
soft
crab
with
cajun
fries
service
fast
and
food
delivery
quick
taste
better
than
boiling
crab
only
issue
is
that
give
more
in
quantity
we
ate
at
lee's
sandwiches
afterwards
to
fill
us
up
after
5
people
3lbs
of
shrimp
which
felt
like
2lbs
1lb
dripping
sauce
My
dealer
never
treated
me
this
well
very
clean
and
super
nice
the
second
you
walk
in
door
That
helps
a
lot
when
buying
pot
believe
me
Thanks
for
experience
why
go
any
where
else

Interesting
design
the
door
almost
looks
like
place
is
under
construction
The
sub-basement
locale
a
bit
strange
but
decor
interesting
We
came
for
an
early
business
dinner
service
was
spot
on
bartender
very
nice
as
well
and
attractive
which
doesn't
hurt
eyes
drinks
were
excellent
food
wasn't
too
great
They
try
to
be
creative
and
result
interesting
looking
with
underwhelming
taste
I
ate
here
about
3
weeks
ago
already
forget
what
it
so
unmemorable
I
went
here
for
a
trim
as
am
trying
to
grow
into
short
bob
had
skin
cancer
on
head
and
have
bald
spot
that
need
cover
explained
in
detail
she
appeared
understand
but
evidently
only
know
one
haircut...when
finished
was
shocked
how
my
hair
is
now...won't
cover
at
all
some
areas
it
1/2
long..-shorter
left
side
right
handed
didn't
check
make
sure
even
around
My
top
good
5
inches
long
I
so
upset...guess
should
better
than
go
someone
working
Walmart
Now
will
purchase
wig
wear
hat
when
outside
without
wig
This
beautician
needs
back
cutting
school
learn
listen
her
customers
It
be

6
months
before
enuf
scar
Beware
of
this
salon
Spend
more

salon
with
expert
cutters
worth
the
extra
spend
too
hot
summer
LV
or
hat.I
sent
bill
place
Do
not
come
here
on
a
slow
weekday
They
close
off
the
2nd
and
3rd
floor
bars/lounge
I
wanted
to
order
specialty
drinks
like
fire
breathing
dragon
but
they
didn't
even
offer
these
at
bar
first
floor
It
wasn't
very
busy
so
seats
were
aplenty
decor
isn't
as
nice
lounge
We
ordered
simple
mixed
weren't
too
great
Paying
12
per
subpar
drink
is
crappy
definitely
make
sure
whole
lounge
open
before
coming
here
I
went
with
a
group
of
girls
last
weekend
We
there
an
appointment
so
they
knew
how
many
people
were
showing
up
this
was
for
the
bridal
party
These
are
not
good
at
all
all
got
manis
and
pedis
look
horrible
Our
feet
still
dirty
All
other
places
I've
been
to
make
sure
cracks
on
our
gone
They
barely
massaged
legs
also
fingernails
horrible
polished
it
horribly
When
we
told
them
wanted
to
redo
nail
polish
said
that
nails
made
like
that
get
manicures
time
never
looked
bad
blame
instead
taking
fault
redoing
job
only
cut
cuticles
hands
will
use
place
again
recommend
anybody
Wish
I
could've
given
more
stars
but
the
staff
is
unfriendly
The
have
a
nice
selection
on
boots
With
really
good
prices
They
watch
you
like
they
think
might
run
out
with
merchandise
and
while
standing
over
do
not
help
cashier
said
this
all
We
paid
she
did
say
thank
or
even
bye
weren't
busy
So
if
your
looking
for
customer
service
then
go
ahead
because
great
I
wasn't
sure
about
this
place
but
it
was
agreed
upon
by
the
group
for
a
convenient
to
grab
quick
bit
after
we
saw
Zumanity
The
sushi
rolls
were
pretty
good
my
mushu
way
too
salty
and
wet
what
cook
doesn't
drain
filling
before
wrapping
it
It
sitting
in
so
much
sauce
had
eat
with
fork
Just
imagine
eating
your
burrito
that
because
swimming
sauce
Too
bad
Our
server
awesome
tho
man
can't
remember
his
name
But
he
cutie
gave
us
very
good
service
only
reason
didn't
send
food
back
FUCK
THIS
PLACE
I
would
give
no
stars
because
this

I
stayed
in
this
hotel
for
my
bachelorette
party
a
little
over
year
ago
with
two
sisters
All
can
say
is
Oh
GAWD
it
was
amazing
Firstly
when
booked
informed
that
would
be
comped
free
bottle
of
alcohol
upon
our
arrival
What
didn't
see
per
night
and
the
range
better
than
most
crappy
liquor
comp's
you
get

we
were
given
Skyy
Vodka
which
happens
to
personal
favorite
large
bottle
at
that
Every
Single
Night
Upon
arrival
hotel
realized
DEFINITELY
young
adult

It's
like
club
there
constantly
Awesome
dance
music
blaring
DJ's
sitting

but
that's
not

only

I've
heart
lot
reviews
from
people
who

We
laid

got
too
hot
into

pretty
perfect

We
tried
appetizers
plates
menus
not
too
deep
which
feel
means
they
focus
on
what
can
be
great
at
rather
than
loose
you
a
confusing
menu
All
meals
disappointed
us
Top

the

are
good
too
Come
with

respectable
Dangerous
place
to

Lots

many
in

so
you

I
stayed
at
the
Flamingo
this
past
weekend
don't
understand
why
place
has
so
many
bad
reviews
Honestly
if
people
want
Bellagio
style
rooms
service
ambiance...then
cross
street
and
go
to
Bellagio
Also
take
extra
money
you'll
need
for
all
of
extras
When
booked
knew
what
was
getting...an
older
hotel
with
really
good
prices
a
fantastic
location
have
no
complaints
whatsoever
about
Flamingo
It
took
me
10-15
minutes
check
in
staff
all
them
which
ran
into
friendly
very
helpful
The
casino
is
little
older
it
smells
like
cigarettes
but
it's
not
unbearable
Free
parking
always
nice
room
itself
decent
clean
wasn't
smelly
falling
apart
inside
had
bed

chairs

couch
TV
planning

too
often
anyway
pool
cool
also
will
say
that
first
time
you
walk
out
habitat
portion
hotel
does
smell
odd
BUT
get
used
it
Most
importantly
LOCATION
did
me
You
can
beat
heart
Vegas
walked
everywhere
went
their
nightclubs
loved
I'd
recommend
who
know
as
important
having
an
amazing
location
center
strip
where
getting
your
easy
especially
after
night
heavy
drinking
rooms
are
good
acceptable
clean
friendly
free
clean
fun
It's
Cesar's
palace
or
Cosmopolitan...but
they're
basically
across
street...go
explore
while
save
by
staying
I
had
been
wanting
to
try
this
restaurant
for
a
long
time
so
high
expectations
love
Mexican
food
The
view
is
5
star
We
went
at
lunch
imagine
the
evening
spectacular
regular
margarita
on
rocks
was
okay
For
9
think
expected
little
better
They
give
you
chips
and
salsa
bean
dip
Which
were
carne
asada
tacos
meat
fatty
me
they
tasted
came
with
beans
rice
which
good
My
friend
ordered
chicken
enchiladas
did
not
them
but
looked
very
Service
will
return
probably
order
tacos
I
met
a
friend
for
lunch
We
sat
on
the
patio
since
it's
somewhat
nice
weather
Phoenix
It's
sprinkling
The
waiter
was
bit
abrupt
unexpected
but
polite
He
seemed
in
hurry
it
empty
Who
knows
ordered
sandwiches
and
were
tasty
house
salad
very
good
Will
be
back
evening
sometime
Disgusting
The
salsa
tasted
like
a
can
of
puree
tomatoes
chicken
tortilla
soup
had
3
small
chunks
and
it
heated
version
the
salsa
hot
Simply
worst
meal
I've
in
while
I
will
never
return
In
fact
felt
robbed
cause
cup
soup
chips
n
Pepsi
was
11.35
before
tip
know
its
Vegas
but
seriously
Do
you
how
many
cans
tomatoes
could
have
bought
with
this
money
made
nasty
for
our
entire
block
This
place
mess
down
to
waiter
who
asked
me
every
5
freaking
minutes
if
needed
anything
The
staff
at
this
wells
fargo
branch
are
great
Friendly
and
very
helpful
They
notarize
no
charge
to
customers
Thanks
for
the
great
service
So
disappointed
I
paid
32
for
brunch
and
the
quality
of
food
felt
just
like
Golden
Corral
Earlier
in
week
ate
at
Wynn
buffet
abs
it
was
great....this
one
a
waste
money
If
had
been
priced
get
10-$15
range
would
have
less
disappointing
Come
on
MGM
Grand
you
can
do
better
Excellent
service
romantic
atmosphere
if
you
actually
go
with
the
right
person
as
its
a
little
nested
lil
cabin-like
house
Everything
is
seasonal
and
fresh
The
salmon
was
amazing
dishes
are
good
but
not
so
much
unique
twist
for
price
Meat
feast
awesomeness
What's
not
to
love
Succulent
meats
and
a
fantastic
salad
bar
Price
is
pretty
steep
but
worth
the
treat
The
fillet
wrapped
in
bacon
lamb
chops
were
my
favorites
We
originally
quoted
40
min
wait
turned
out
be
less
than
10
Our
waitress
was
attentive
sweet
Really
nice
bathrooms
bar
area
Highly
recommend
I
have
been
coming
here
for
10
years
good
quality
Mexican
food
and
that
is
what
get
all
of
the
time
The
service
great
chips
salsa
spicy
amazing
Def
going
back
more
when
am
craving
homemade
way
my
nana
makes
it
I
was
turned
off
immediately
when
the
hostess
tried
to
steer
me
crowded
smokey
bar
eat
Sat
in
near
vacant
dining
section
eat
a
flavorless
pulled
pork
sandwich

Washed
it
down
with
an
eight
dollar
draft
beer
From
the
moment
my
family
and
I
arrived
to
hotel
we
were
greeted
by
friendly
staff
The
Valet
attendant
was
nicest
guy
Our
room
clean
staff
attentive
our
needs
I'm
definitely
staying
at
MGM
again
Great
place
as
always
service
The
tater
tots
are
excellent
and
of
course
the
beer
is
good
Oyster
Bar
is
the
BOMB
My
husband
and
I
never
stayed
at
Palace
Station
but
we
only
come
here
to
eat
Bar
We
ordered
house
gumbo
Alaskin
calm
chowder
combo
pan
roast
All
delicious
They
pack
your
bowl
with
tons
of
seafood
Very
filling
satisfying
The
huge
which
can
feed
up
2
people
If
you
plan
share
a
someone
they
will
charge
an
extra
5
A
seafood
like
this
you'd
rather
want
own
because
it's
so
good
There's
15
seating
Expect
1

hours
wait
Friendly
staff
cook
We'll
be
back
for
sure
I
have
been
twice
for
happy
hour
Both
times
were
fantastic
Had
a
deviled
egg
flight
and
bruschetta
both
times
My
brother
had
slider
olive
bowl
All
was
great
The
service
top
notch
the
owner
even
came
over
to
introduce
herself
Ignore
negative
reviews
come
give
this
place
try
I
ate
here
on
a
Saturday
night
They
didn't
have
any
open
reservations
due
to
the

The

For
years
around
this

was
the
only
good
non-chain
coffee
store

everyone

fairly
acceptable
and

aren't

cheap
as
you
would
find

It
too
cool

vats
where
beer
is
made
This
used
to
be
good
Even
worth
the
drive
They
raised
price
changed

and
took

We

will
definitely
take
out
of

guests
Had
food
with
Brenda
she's
always
the
best
Food
is
definitely
OK
service
great
I
am
a
huge
fan
of
this
restaurant
vegetarian
and
loved
the
fact
that
they
had
so
many
vegan
options
The
rainbow
roll
is
amazing
plated
beautifully
restaurant
also
offers
soy
paper
rice
instead
seaweed
went
with
friend
who
was
new
to
sushi
server
walked
her
through
menu
helped
pick
out
perfect
roll
I
came
here
for
dinner
i
will
keep
it
short
It
is
expensive
yes
they
spent
a
lot
on
renovation
its
definately
the
higher
end
side
of
Chinese
dining
have
been
to
few
vegetarian
restaurants
and
usually
portions
are
small
was
shocked
see
that
were
large
here
Presentation
nice
most
all
service
very
attentive
proper
felt
unusual
because
am
use
asian
places
with
crappy
service
typical
serving
mock
meats
waitress
told
us
do
not
this
there
no
simulated
meats
here
instead
options
create
whole
new
unique
dishes
did
find
bit
oily
taste
tad
bland
my
liking
overall
3/5
due
high
prices
This
place
is
outstanding
It's
tucked
away
in
a
strip
mall
but
definitely
worth
the
trip
Quite
possibly
best
Gyro
I've
ever
eaten
Large
portion
size
and
incredible
flavor
I
highly
recommend
Mezza
to
anyone
mood
for
Mediterranean
food
Lunch
service
was
fast
and
accurate
I
asked
for
an
8
spice
level
that's
exactly
what
got
which
is
refreshing
Rive
a
tad
overcooked
but
the
cashew
tofu
perfect
The
vegetables
weren't
they
did
not
skimp
Will
be
back
weekly
at
this
point
After
moving
from
New
York
I
was
pretty
disappointed
with
Toronto's
delivery
options
then
found
Rashnaa
and
things
improved
It's
a
dependable
choice
for
lazy
nights
Most
of
the
entrees
travel
well
which
is
good
because
rarely
quick
I'm
near
Skydome
it
takes
45-60
minutes
My
favorite
are
mutton
curry
butter
chicken
The
appetizers
less
reliable
probably
most
them
fried
Sometimes
beef
pancake
OK
Can't
speak
about
dine-in
experience
but
it's
keeper
delivery
Visited
for
dinner
on
a
weekday
around
5:30pm
and
the
place
was
packed
The
line
pretty
long
but
it
moved
quickly
food
ready
almost
immediately
after
ordering
I
got
Chicken
Souvlaki
to
share
because
portions
were
huge
definitely
would
not
have
been
able
finish
my
own
rice
potatoes
tasty
chicken
delicious
especially
with
tzatziki
sauce
feel
like
salad
we
little
overdressed
preference
so
probably
order
sauce
side
next
time
come
also
tried
bit
of
pork
that
someone
else
at
table
ordered
felt
dry

much
preferred
over
pork
Overall
value
here
is
great
their
are
good
sharing
if
you
don't
huge
appetite
Also
as
many
others
mentioned
they
only
take
cash
This
I'd
stop
by
in
area
though
know
go
out
way
come
back
I've
been
coming
to
Casey
Moore's
at
least
once
a
week
on
Thursdays
sit
the
bar
and
have
LUNCH
socialize
with
local
regulars
since
2013
when
I
first
wrote
my
review
love
this
place
This
place
has
so
much
character
stories
food
drinks
are
way
above
typical
quality
It's
definite
must
try
dozen
oysters
an
ice
col
beer
kick
back
enjoy
scene
Sad
when
you
book
an
appointment
three
weeks
prior
arrive
Try
to
explain
and
then
have
them
call
security
on
your
15
year
old
daughter
because
she's
crying
It's
homecoming
was
for
her
two
friends
They
all
their
appointments
confused
The
lady
at
the
counter
wouldn't
even
try
listen
Had
go
Lancôme
counter
How
sad
ruin
a
homecoming
day
both
of
my
daughters
Beware

Also

didn't
rinse
suds
off

half
of

complained
they
told
me
to
pull

go

Same
result
The
third

then

it
No

Just

I
was
really
excited
to
try
cajun/creole
food
while
visiting
Charlotte
but
not
that
impressed
by
the
dishes
we
ordered
here
Our
waiter
nice
and
checked
up
on
us
often
The
two
of
decided

Jambalaya
Came
with
a
good

meat
seafood
TOO
SALTY
side
cornbread
also
forgettable
Dry
just
whatevs
Shrimp
po
boy
liked
this
sandwich
overall
it
seemed
like
regular
fried
sub
bread
actually
very
fresh
pieces
weren't
small
or
skimpy
FRIES
though
were
CRISPY
seasoned
well
My
favorite
part
meal
sure
would
come
back
fries
This
lot
both
us
left
pretty
stuffed
Not
sure
I'd
make
my
way
here

I
come
here
about
once
a
month
to
get
my
greasy
Chinese
food
fix
It
hardly
ever
disappoints
This
is
the
best
in
valley
My
favorite
dishes
are
Chicken
Chow
Mein
fried
rice
always
ask
for
rice
General
Tso's
Chicken
and
Beef
Fun
They
have
crab
puffs
had
although
it
should
be
noted
that
heavy
bias
towards
food
Lately
I've
also
been
indulging
their
chicken
french
fries
only
knock
on
egg
rolls
aren't
always
consistent
Some
days
they're
really
good
others
well
more
like
average
Never
gross
however
The
service
great
you
can
expect
your
drink
refilled
timely
manner
For
30
family
of
four
eat
comfortably
still
plenty
take
home
A
word
caution
health
nuts
may
not
all
much
haven

indulgence
that's
marvelous
One

Of

o
tender
and
flavorful

It

young

nightmares
They
nightmares

disconnect-and
YOU
call
back
again
Several
times
of
this-finally
had
an

With

I

not

why
others

like
this
place
Our

came
with
free
coffee
from
thought
they
would
be
rude
because
of
the
free
but
were
nice
each
time
The
was
great
too
I
LOVEEEEEEE
CHIPOTLE
can
never
say
anything
bad
about
them
My
food
is
always
fresh
and
the
service
on
point
Tons
of
fun
I
saw
Calvin
Harris
spin
here
over
the
weekend
can't
complain
We
had
a
table
and
bottle
service
fairly
close
to
DJ
they
cocktail
waitresses
were
great
very
attentive
assisted
in
pouring
drinks
almost
whole
night
love
how
gave
out

around
2am
The
place
itself
it
stunning
say
would
go
if
didn't
have
table
as
was
packed
but
you
service
it's
definitely
ton
fun
will
blast
I
don't
have
anything
good
to
say
just
know
won't
ever
go
back
Service
goes
a
long
way
in
getting
customers
lot
of
restaurants
bars

take
lots
people
with
me
None
whom
will
be
going
B&T
I
try
fish
tacos
everywhere
go
The
Tavares
Wahoo
might
be
the
best
have
ever
had
anywhere
Great
spice
and
flavor
they
do
not
skimp
on
like
a
lot
of
places
Good
beer
selection
awesome
corn
salsa
Cool
neighborhood
atmosphere
Limited
but
nice
patio
seating
Will
back
for
sure
I
was
going
to
give
a
5
star
rating
because
for
who
they
are
the
owners
are
busting
their
buts
have
own
type
of
restaurant
But
after
saw
follow
up
on
KN
tonight
can
only
1
star
even
BEFORE
come
The
reason
this
is
so
little
has
changed
since
original
airing
show
and
what
update
recently
will
be
visiting
restaurant
my
next
trip
out
West
In
response
owner's
comments
recently
introduce
myself
Amy
Ylep
post
I'm
not
hiding
behind
computer
After
come
return
again
husband
said
stuppid
people
become
smart
back
purpose
me
writing
review
that
had
hope
would
change
attitude
towards
employees
They
don't
understand
although
employees
do
restaurant
make
or
break
business
beg
learn
treat
them
better
think
about
how
it
felt
when
work
someone
else
Since
fired
entire
staff
too
optomistic
Employees
owe
you
anything
there
provide
service
fee
When
start
take
those
fees
away
the
tips
earn
then
in
wrong
How
our
future
leaders
back
haunt
you
Lastly
am
expecting
good
food
service
if
receive
known
did
notice
business
still
growing
few
customers
All
read
posts
sites
same
way
everyone
else
does
get
your
answers
WHY
Friendliest
service
I
have
ever
seen
at
a
fast
food
place
I've
very
rarely
had
any
mistakes
in
my
order
and
they
fix
them
promptly
with
smile
All
American
Pub
is
the
slightly
less
sexy
sister
of
The
Oak
Room
But
who
doesn't
like
an
All
American
girl
Who
cares
if
she's
sexy
because
fun
and
low
key
We
went
to
Room
open
until
10
we
needed
kill
some
time
I
am
so
glad
came
here
first
got
dance
a
little
bit
enjoy
drink
specials
They
have
really
cheap
mimosas
as
well
selection
cider
2
things
that
make
for
great
night
out
waitress
was
very
nice
although
didn't
eat
any
food
it
looked
good
Some
other
people

table
pretzel
with
cheese
yum
cheeseburger

When
go
back
will
defintely
be
trying
out
myself
Worst
experience
ever
Liars
I
told
them
over
the
phone
exactly
what
needed
and
had
happened
Then
get
some
bs
AFTER
been
towed
there
tow
truck
left
that
they
couldn't
perform
requested
service
we
got
into
a
heated
debate
said
this
is
why
you
guys
bad
rap
auto
industry
look
like
shit
to
world
was
leave
aren't
working
on
your
car
treated
badly
lied
immediately
went
cutthroat
far
more
expensive
work
repair
done
Without
ever
even
LOOKING
at
my
vehicle
This
place
sucks
con
artists
liars
Don't
make
mistake
of
going
here
There
are
FAR
better
shops
than
these
idiots
want
5
star
rating
These
suck
This
is
a
standard
yet
always
dependable
place
to
meet
friends
and
have
lunch
or
dinner
they
some
really
good
food
consistant
on
the
flavor
service
I
will
come
back
This
place
is
sooo
good
Best
dumplings
I've
had
in
Toronto
for
sure
And
at
such
a
good
price
We
got
all
this

drink
and
green
onion
cake
under
25
The
are
so
fresh
flavourful
I
can't
wait
to
go
back
My
favourite
was
the
crab
meat
dumplings
Mmmm
No
customer
service
Food
is
ok
but
no
smiles
girl
at
the
counter
couldn't
even
look
me
in
eyes
Just
need
better
training
I
bought
my
wedding
dress
here
and
I'm
so
glad
did
It
really
was
stunning
made
me
feel
incredibly
beautiful
on
special
day
The
got
from
their
off
the
rack
collection
tailored
to
size
petite
gown
needed
a
lot
of
work
They
took
time
effort
ensure
completely
satisfied
with
end
result
staff
are
patient
understanding
even
when
overly
emotional
during
process
as
many
brides
getting
dresses
do
amazing
work
have
some
gorgeous
dresses
available
highly
recommend
them
Thank
you
much

Ok
when
it
comes
to

there
are
essentially
two

There

compare
And

Intrigued
after
seeing
the
Matcha
Maca
on
insta
I
had
to
drop
by

The

delicious
they
serve
it
a
straw
and
spoon
They
recommend
you
eat
top
first
then
sip
rest
of
matcha
through
straw
No
Don't
do
this
After
have

Wimpy's

has
been
a
staple
on
royal

for

and
we've
always
dying

though
would
be
okay
checking
this
place
out
again
trying
something
else
Service
good
but
we
came
during
lunch
rush
only
one

so
did
take
some
time

Not

will
try
again

In

targeted
mainly
for

I'm
sure

are

Went
to
Harris
Grill
last
night
for
my
in
Pittsburgh
Really
cool
experience
and
it
was
a
beautiful
sit
outside
enjoy
the
atmosphere
First
Tuesday
is
bacon
I'm
not
quite
sure
how
works
but
I
heard
it's
free
at
bar
1
baskets
of
if
you're
sitting
table
My
friends
had
drink
some
while
we
waited
table
obviously
hit
makes
restaurant
busy
really
enjoyed
selection
beers
wanted
try
Game
Thrones
beer
liked
amber
beer
they
too
much
switch
As
an
app
shared
buffalo
chicken
dip
It
biggest
portion
always
nice
eating
grilled
pita
instead
just
tortilla
chips
every
so
often
The
dip
very
large
pieces
crusted
with
blue
cheese
Pretty
basic
well
executed
menu
pretty
simple
difficult
read
been
there
before
knew
what
look
for
time
reading
through
commentary
trying
tell
each
dish
One
recommended
something
he
gotten
before
decided
that
easier
than
wasting
menu
got
mac
cheese
added
lobster
bacon
decadent
better
expected
creamy
flow-y
A
lot
times
on
doesn't
flow
well
consistency
Grill's
also
delicious
bacon
put
top
So
basically
strips
expecting
either
bits
mixed
everything
or
even
submerged
Nonetheless
crispy
i
dipped
few
which
solid
idea
God
I
have
no
idea
why
my
relatives
love
this
place
The
only
thing
can
think
of
is
because
they
are
from
Utah
and
to
them
awesome
japanese
food
Perhaps
it
was
we
were
in
a
big
group
which
really
shouldn't
an
effect
on
anything
but
the
service
piss
poor
So
ordered
our
food
gave
waitress
sushi
ordering
paper
at
table
Simple
sushi...Inari
Tamago
California
roll
Easy
right
Should
be
out
10-15
minutes
That
came
when
halfway
done
with
dinner
We
sake
also
had
remind
she
forgot
all
about
it
all...this
palce
goes
down
book
worse
than
what
orginally
rated
Wow
reading
the
reviews
on
here
I
am
either
one
of
few
lucky
ones
or
management
has
made
some
changes
as
my
salesman
hinted
at
during
sales
process
also
used
service
department
so
will
break
review
down
into
two
parts
Sales
As
many
negative
have
even
said
this
was
pretty
easy
and
much
less
hassle
than
other
dealerships

My

absolutely
love
it
The
worship
is
amazing
pastors
sermons

straight
from

Excellent

service

I
will
surely
be
repeat
customer
Thanks
guys
Very
over
priced
very
small
portions
chicken
breast
was
extremely
dried
out
I
got
take
out
and
shocked
when
home
saw
how
little
in
the
container
two
or
3
tiny
bite
size
pieces
Out
of
curiosity
took
pieces
put
them
on
my
food
scale
at
there
2.3
oz
for
9.99

taxes
almost
12.00
So
paid
12.00
a
bowl
rice
container
sauce
Having
said
that
will
say
good
sauce
tasted
good
but
not
12.00
is
even
half
breast
typical
weighs
approx
6
oz
doubt
this
place
survive
long
if
they
don't
change
their
prices
offer
full
serving
protein
price
For
customer
should
be
receiving
with
rice
This
also
trying
to
attract
university
students
going
happen
these

students
want

If
used
dark
meat
which
what
butter
chicken
able

cheaper
price
wouldn't
does
plus
customers
would
then
hopefully
get
regular

Too
bad
hoping
they'd
succeed
here
cause
we
need
more
affordable
options
area
office/business
workers
those
can't
possible
come

changed

Awesome
BBQ
The
cornbread
is
served
fresh
and
hot
Honestly
best
I've
ever
had
We
ordered
The
Whole
Pig
it
was
epically
delicious
split
between
two
but
it's
honestly
enough
for
maybe
3-4
Very
friendly
quick
staff
Highly
recommend
Forget
the
steak
it's
about
prime
rib
For
14
you
get
a
good
size
rib
choice
of
potato
and
veggies
The
rib
was
flavorful
not
overly
salty
green
beans
were
hecka
tasty
might
be
some
best
I've
had
in
long
while
steak
fries
little
too
pale
for
my
taste
shrimp

definitely

when
go
to
Denny's
or
similar
establishments
BTW
special
everyone
on
Yelp
raves
menu

well
at
least
didn't
see
it
Other
important
info
can
found
CAFE
side
BBQ
side
service
painfully
slow
50
mins
food
tables
are
really
close
together
apparently
they
have
root
beer
which
is
listed
under
their
soda
section
costs
more
than
soda
Great
food
amazing
service
found
a
new
diamond
in
the
rough
here
Las
Vegas
just
so
been
10
days
ago
their
is
presentation
everyone
super
friendly
place
you
can
come
to
on
regular
basis
really
affordable
prices
bon
appétit
I
hate
to
give
only
2
stars
because
the
food
was
very
good
But
service
so
awful
will
not
come
back
for
just
food
It's
a
seat
yourself
restaurant
and
empty
tables
were
dirty
No
servers
or
employees
around
ask
clean
one
Finally
started
cleaning
it
ourselves
this
brought
someone
over
The
server
spotty
in
attendance
Drinks
filled
one
time
we
there
an
hour
chips
n
guacamole
salad
torta
am
surprised
at
lack
of
service
Manager
no
where
be
found
talk
either
First
of
all
if
you
ever
visited
Anzio's
landing
which
was
in
this
location
previously
change
your
expectations
It
upscale
but
tired
so
I
wasn't
terribly
surprised
that
it
had
closed
But
don't
feel
the
need
to
dress
up
nearly
as
much
at
new
steakhouse
It's
significantly
cheaper
and
people
wear
whatever
they
like
wearing
is
fine
just
manage
So
REALLY
concept
place
love
being
able
cook
each
bite
my
steak
exactly
how
want
it
The
bread
delicious
tastes
homemade
compared
other
restaurant
breads
outback
texas
roadhouse
or
like
steaks
are
seasoned
well
sides
leave
a
bit
be
desired
I'm
not
coming
here
for
sides
unique
really
hope
business
takes
off
doubt
will
it's
entirely
because
way
managed
can
hire
consultant
help
fix
these
weird
issues
have
come
up
I've
been
several
times
noticed
some
reoccurring
issues
there
no
dedicated
host
staff
seat
you
especially
busy
member
or
manager
walking
through
lobby
you
Once
someone
said
would
prepare
table
then
while
were
preparing
it
2
3
more
asked
we
helped
sets
disorganized
frankly
vibe
already
one
two
took
ownership
seating
make
all
difference
Second
goes
without
saying
tables
by
runway
cool
should
constantly
full
possible
once
went
towards
end
day
so
seems
improbable
would've
reservations
seated
next
aisle
got
deal
with
carts
rolling
traffic
right
windows
empty
when
sat
open
dirty
our
entire
dinner
the
large
booth
corner
extremely
dirty
affected
dinner
maybe
busser
turn
around
those
prime
faster
realize
sometimes
now
having
sign
says
yourself
doesn't
seem
great
management
either
roll
Third
sadly
most
sharp
Most
servers
timid
on
recent
visit
server
refreshingly
assertive
friendly
nice
manager
owner
kind
lurks
an
uncomfortable
well
lessening
time
by
appreciate
quick
check
execution
wrong
Fourth
mentioned
reviews
service
little
slow
normal
standards
exceptionally
consider
arriving
uncooked
something
needs
done
expedite
this
although
again
things
seemed
faster
last
assertive
sorry
can't
remember
her
name
These
glaring
we've
actually
imagined
Gordon
Ramsay
helping
them
run
place
he
say
process
and
could
charge
more
managed
right
Update
May
17
2016
it
seems
that
there's
some
new
management
They
seemed
to
improved
Not
a
good
experience
Definitely
tried
upswell
multiple
times
and
was
angry
when
I
asked
questions
about
my
shellac
Focused
more
on
bringing
in
customers
than
trying
keep
the
ones
they
currently
had
happy
won't
be
coming
back
I
don't
know
if
tonight
the
cooks
were
just
didn't
want
to
be
here
or
what
but
all
3
burgers
received
in
my
order
still
raw
noticed
mine
was
a
little
pink
brother's
burger
and
his
wife's
really
pink
love
n
out
this
is
first
for
me
I'm
used
quality
of
service
meet
that
usually
delivers
Could
not
of
had
a
better
experience
with
furniture
shopping
Josh
the
assistant
manager
went
above
and
beyond
to
help
us
buy
sofa
ottoman
tv
console
He
is
definition
excellent
customer
service
I
my
pieces
delivered
concern
about
one
them
he
made
me
feel
like
still
great
purchase
The
at
this
place
beautiful
reasonable
prices
Will
continue
come
here
for
all
needs
in
future
This
review
is
for
their
brunch
The
brunch
menu
nothing
huge
and
a
lot
of
the
dishes
seem
somewhat
similar
Having
said
that
Tiger
Prawn
Corn
Tamale
must
It's
got
rich
Southwestern
flavor
appeared
on
Best
Thing
I
Ever
Ate
reason
Other
than
that
item
most
everything
good
but
far
from
top-notch
If
you
like
little
spice
in
your
brunch
this
as
spot
any
My
husband
and
I
decided
to
dine
here
celebrate
his
birthday
our
wedding
anniversary
We
have
been
living
in
Las
Vegas
for
a
year
but
never
inside
the
Stratosphere
There
are
signs
hotel
that
direct
you
restaurant
although
it
is
quite
walk
well
at
least
seemed
way
first
time
They
make
through
Tower
Shops
so
may
run
into
annoying
sales
people
who
work
kiosks
After
check
in
they
will
send
security
checkpoint
So
leave
all
your
weapons
anything
illegal
home
LOL
Dress
code
business
casual
we
did
see
few
wearing
jeans
Well
best
thing
about
this
place
view
went
night
was
amazing
The
restaurant
revolves
360
degrees
every
80
minutes
goes
slowly
don't
really
feel
like
moving
think
motor
underneath
or
near
booth
sat
because
often
felt
butts
vibrate
food
alright
honestly
expecting
much
more
from
this
ordered
Roasted
Scottish
Salmon
with
creamy
Fennel
Sauce
know
salmon
salmon
But
one
very
tasty
sauce
added
lot
of
flavor
16
oz
Rib

my
ordered

Cookies
Cream
Cheesecake
Lollipops
You
dip

Oreos
Each

2
lollipops

good
little
too
sweet
me
Ice
Cream
huge

Customer
Service
average
Our
server
nice
he
rarely
around
refilled
drinks
attentive
Also
woman
taking
pictures
table
passed
by
ignored
us
times
Maybe
she
has
something
against
Asians
Honestly
would
want
come
back
again
price
quality
not
equal
I'm
glad
got
experience
this
Things
I
love
The
happy
hour
beer
5
pitches
of
local
beer
is
a
spanking
deal
Thai
hummus
and
ceviche
for
fresh
snack
cheese
plate
Even
this
lactose-intolerant
lady
will
steal
bite
valet
as
parking
super
limited
don't
love
so
much
the
cocktails
Poor
form
on
my
part
who
gets
cocktail
at
brewery
entrees
They
taste
like
they're
just
menu
filler/something
to
eat
with
Stick
many
small
plates
I've
been
coming
here
for
about
two
months
now
So
probably
4
times
total
The
first
time
I
came
it
was
because
my
regular
nail
place
couldn't
fit
me
in
having
issues
with
nails
constantly
breaking
before
weeks
up
but
didn't
complain
at
the
other
they
fixed
free
When
guy
started
filling
realized
why
had
breaking
previous
wasn't
taking
their
time
This
took
his
and
basically
clipped
filed
off
everything
that
weak
or
would
have
broken
While
he
doing
noticed
some
3D
design
examples
asked
them
said
yeah
can
def
do
them
when
done
acrylic
part
moved
over
to
another
young
woman
who
did
part
She's
one
who's
fills
every
afterwards
honestly
wish
taken
pictures
of
jobs
I'll
update
this
review
weekly
she
does
an
amazing
job
like
really
flashy
complicated
stuff
takes
her
makes
sure
all
add
on
there
stays
full
weeks
work
somewhere
open
a
lot
boxes
type
keyboard
long
They
still
last
rhinestones
flowers
it
only
break
I'm
rough
People
literally
stop
in
public
ask
nails
I
had
an
hour
to
kill
before
taking
a
friend
the
airport
for
his
redeye
flight
so
decided
grab
quick
bite
sat
at
counter
Cafe
24/7
and
order
shrimp
poboy
sandwich
around
1015pm
to-go
of
eggs
benedict
To
my
disappointment
food
took
over
45
mins
A
fries
takes
that
long
make
on
Tuesday
night
You
would
have
guessed
they
sailed
some
ship
casted
large
nets
shrimp
leave
asked
go
along
with
benedict
requested
1030pm
left
1115pm
Once
got
home
open
styrofoam
box
looking
heat
up
finding
thin
black
hair
in
order
That's
disgusting
know
mistakes
happen
but
your
then
coming
home
starving
find
unexpected
protein
meal
am
apalled
by
quality
deliverance
meal
management
really
needs
accessed
productivity
their
staff
Additionally
you
will
not
get
any
type
cell
coverage
sitting
this
restaurant
That
itself
immediate
attention
as
can't
contact
one
who
may
need
you
Woke
up
early
on
a
Saturday
morning
just
to
try
the
truck
with
my
roomie
at
Farmer's
Market
Let's
say
Vegasm
is
that
Those
sun-dried
tomatoes
pesto...all
of
it
was
enough
make
girl
swoon
and
then
some
The
line
looked
super
intimidating
but
I'd
we
had
our
food
in
around
5
minutes
Prompt
piping
hot
delicious
Did
I
mention
they
take
card
My
only
complaint
that
cater
mostly
Engineering
Quad
see
parked
Wright
Green
like
clock
work
it's
by
this
remote
street
way
into
computer
science
land
Not
terrible
why
can't
you
give
humanities
some
love
Or
South
Quad
Just
suggestion
Every
time
I
come
to
Las
Vegas
make
a
point
here
only
because
it
feels
so
comforting
and
homely
This
last
time
came
during
slower
shift
wasn't
greeted
for
almost
15
minutes
Its
usually
not
like
this
When
our
server
did
show
up
turned
out
be
the
same
we
had
night
before
forgot
her
name
but
she
was
great
Really
made
up
in
lack
of
service
beginning
Great
food
but
service
left
a
lot
to
be
desired
Went
here
last
night
and
had
reservation
it
took
17
minutes
for
the
waiter
take
our
drink
order
That
would
have
been
fine
if
they
were
busy
there
more
open
tables
than
filled
tables
The
was
AMAZING
I
pulled
chicken
tacos
with
retried
beans
chips
salsa
are
PERFECT
We
finished
meal
waited
what
felt
like
FOREVER
come
back
so
we
could
ask
check
Other
extremely
slow
can't
beat
My
favorite
Italian
restaurant
Everything
I
have
tried
has
been
to
die
for
They
make
a
great
sangria
We
do
low-carb
and
the
eggplant
appetizer
with
antipasto
platter
really
hits
spot
This
place
is
real
treat
super
service
Chicken
was
eh
It
used
to
be
a
lot
better
Service
good
but
the
food
wasn't
Consistency
is
tough
Best
cake/cupcakes
I
ever
had
Decadent
cake
and
delicious
buttercream
Designs
are
beautiful
Highly
recommend
Just
can't
say
enough
about
these
guys
Their
techs(mike
and
Dan
are
really
friendly
knowledgable
I
have
a
new
born
in
the
house
AC
broke
Mike
came
out
fixed
it
5-10
mins
The
only
thing
that
is
negative
them
their
office
It
was
always
hard
to
get
hold
of
them
had
call
like
10-20
times
before
could
reach
someone
The
décor
at
Eden's
Grill
is
basic
but
the
food
anything
but
This
quality
Mediterranean
dining
as
evidenced
by
walls
lined
with
New
Times
Best
of
Phoenix
awards
from
years
past
pita
bread
fresh
and
portions
served
are
huge
You
rarely
see
a
party
leaving
without
least
one
or
two
containers
leftovers
Many
regulars
evident
There
small
outdoor
dining
area
Not
sure
if
its
dog
friendly
I
suspect
it
may
be
only
reluctantly
don't
care
for
five
dollar
fee
to
split
an
entre
Most
dinner
entrees
about
fifteen
bucks
serving
sizes
large
so
sharing
rationale
approach
all
most
robust
appetites
Also
expect
warm
welcome
you
try
order
menu
al
carte
think
it's
fine
bring
your
kids
here
sense
that
encouraged
They
did
throw
in
extra
upon
request
our
leftovers
on
recent
visit
Nice
Any
complaints
really
very
minor
comparison
strengths
restaurant
family
owned
operated
establishment
definitely
worth
experiencing
I've
been
here
a
few
times
and
there
is
always
wait
but
its
really
worth
it
The
food
everything
you
want
out
of
big
breakfast
lol
Awesome
Shabu
Best
in
Vegas
by
far
Figured
I'd
have
to
go
back
Orange
County
eat
decent
Shabu
but
this
place
hit
the
spot
Heard
about
it
on
Adam
Carolla
podcast
had
check
out
support
Joy
pirate
ship
Had
house
beef
and
finished
off
meal
with
green
tea/white
chocolate
fondue
Classic
Friday
Night
Fish
Fry
Joint
Although
I've
heard
the
burgers
are
great
as
well
I
had
perch
breaded
instead
battered
It
was
fantastic
nicely
seasoned
with
a
bit
of
crunch
it
baked
potato
But
you
have
choice
baked
hash
browns
or
cowboy
potatoes
You
also
get
roll

nothing
special
but
necessity
for
decent
fish
fry
cole
slaw
Companion
cod
digged
slaw
she
three
them
I'd
come
back
this
is
classic
tavern
consistent
food
and
really
friendly
staff
know
my
mantra

Eat
at
local
joints
LOVE
the
annual
sale
Great
opportunity
for
stocking
up
on
gifts
out
of
town
guests
The
staff
are
accommodating
without
being
pushy
Always
pick
another
bell
myself
too
Outstanding
This
place
has
the
best

pricy
I
don't
write
a
lot
of
reviews
but
this
one
i
had
to
do
used
be
usual
here
then
changed
my
location
went
back
today
and
it
was
the
same
people
excellent
quality
Much
better
than
franchise
pizza
or
even
most
terroni
pizzas
It's
rich
delicious
there's
no
lack
toppings
The
have
smoked
chicken
pizza
which
is
soo
good
they
what
call
snack
hard
eat
sometimes
not
enough
napkins
around
it's
irresistible
unfortunately
deliver
cater
if
you
them
earlier
told
me
they'll
prepare
so
that
u
can
pick
up
go
Felt
like
deserves
review
considering
with
all
competition
getting
from
neighborhood
stick
high
quality
stuff
to
I'll
definitely
stop
by
again
when
in
may
i'll
just
order
up
San
Vy
and
Ruby
are
wonderful
They
answered
all
my
questions
helped
me
through
every
step
of
the
buying
process
I
can't
be
thankful
enough
for
their
guidance
highly
recommend
them
Tried
this
out
late
on
a
Friday
night
and
was
happy
to
have
gone
The
ramen
pretty
darn
good
if
not
mind-blowing
the
gyoza
everything
I
wanted
except
for
being
300
times
too
small
Quick
and
easy
check
in
Excellent
service
Renting

Great
place

take
some
Come

people
that
every
second
hand
used

They

might
get
lucky
most
of
it
even
drive
from
Phoenix/Glendale
area
know
what

it's
worth
gas
for
me
This
the
hands
down
worst
Don
Tortaco
I've
ever
been
to
If
you
have
a
quick
craving
for
some
Mexican
food
you're
better
off
driving
an
extra
2-5
minutes
to
Roberto's
street
Potions
are
so
scarce
and
wait
time
is
horrendous
I
dropped
in
on
Tuesday
afternoon
there
was
only
2
other

no
one
drive
thru
it
took
them
10

take
my

There
else

could

would
Finally
there
is

wasn't
nothing
it
more
topping
in
then
nothing
And
my
husband
grill
beef
he
said
bad
Never
coming
here
again
had
better
places
this
Hands
down
the
best
portobello
burger
I've
ever
tasted
I'm
over
moon
that
this
location
opened
since
it's
much
closer
to
me
then
original

nice
and
roomy
inside
I
came
on
a
Saturday
around
noon
for
take
out
order
It
definitely
gets
busy
very
quickly
so
wait
can
get
little
bit
long
but
still
worth
it
They
have
quite
few
vegetarian
options
as
well
fresh
juices
even
booze
really
can't
say
enough
good
things
about
place
never
eaten
anything
here
don't
like
staff
is
friendly
Sip
is
one
of
those
so
good
places
that
you
almost
don't
want
to
review
because
its
already
hard
enough
find
a
parking
spot
in
the
tiny
lot
By
way
thats
only
negative
I
haven't
had
food
but
coffee
beyond
wonderful
My
favorite
cold
brew
iced
with
carmel
and
almond
milk
The
atmosphere
wonderful
cool
art
laid
back
vibes
They
have
plenty
seating
both
indoor
outdoor
staff
also
very
friendly
fun
If
any
questions
just
ask
them
One
thing
must
say
they
seem
be
hiring
new
some
employees
baristas
really
rise
above
rest
I
had
such
a
long
day
today
that
by
the
time
school
ended
was
soooo
hungry
could
eat
UNICORN
After
what
seemed
like
an
hour's
worth
of
bus
rides
and
sure
enough
it
took
me
to
get
Fashion
Show
Mall
from
CSN
west
charleston
campus
my
galpal
and
opted
meet
at
food
court
There
ordered
6
tuna
sandwich

with
herbs
cheese
bread
cheddar
toasted
tomatoes
cucumbers
red
onions
sweet
onion
sauce
for
5

tax
guess
it's
safe
say
gone
in
less
than
10
minutes
The
vegetables
were
fresh
loved
how
subway's
isn't
oozing
mayonnaise
We
then
returned
after
our
meal
ourselves
some
cookies
For
75cents
you
1
but
2
yourself
3
Being
sweet-tooth
we
are
2
Chocolate
Chip
cookies
White
Macademia
cookie
When
desserts
already
about
6:20pm
so
sadly
there
weren't
anymore
Raspberry
Cheesecake
Cookies
ultimate
favourite
So
if
ever
head
Subway
can
now
keep
mind
they're
not
merely
limited
just
sandwiches
There's
no
doubt
subway'll
always
be
preferred
go-to
over
McDonalds
healthier
more
stuffing
between
bread...and
they've
got
sweet'er
side
them
too
I've
really
enjoyed
all
my
visits
to
El
Sombrero
as
it
is
some
of
the
best
Mexican
food
in
Calgary
but
that's
always
qualifier
In
Calgary
It
has
a
great
location
on
17th
Avenue
and
restaurant
just
darling
I
love
colourful
authentic
decor
was
very
tasty
recently
went
for
friend's
birthday
soo
good
had
fajitas
which
were
tasty
stole
other
peoples
too
as
far
taste
tests
went
everything
delicious
The
staff
friendly
made
fun
night
around
I've
stayed
and
I
loved
it
Very
clean
a
decent
breakfast
friendly
peeps
thought
it
was
good
price
did
have
pool
Very
quietly
restaurant
and
very
friendly
service
The
Golden
seafood
chowder
has
some
fried
crisp
bacons.It's
delicious
Warm
mushroom
salad
is
also
great
Sad
I've
stayed
at
a
lot
of
places
around
Las
Vegas
Everything
from
the
old
Westward
Ho
and
Circus
to
Bellagio
Venetian
Palms
several
others
Luxor
was
surprise
not
good
one
Of
course
like
all
strip
hotels
it
has
pretty
nice
public
spaces
c'mon
pyramid
concept
itself
is
cool
butt
he
rooms
are
just
sad
On
this
visit
pools
spas
drained
my
others
I
know
dated
worn
furniture
beddings
marks
on
walls
And
don't
even
think
expect
hot
water/coffee
maker
That's
only
for
Motel
6s
Holiday
Inn
Express...ok
sarcastic
there
As
there
mandatory
resort
fee...not
really
what
sure
as
tubs
shutdown...internet
included
with
that
16/day
fee
Not
wifi...it's
ethernet
cable
What
hoot
Big
picture
PROS
Clean

simple
CONS
Dated
WAAAY
overdue
renovation
no
amenities
in
room
all
Verdict
For
price
many
more
choices
won't
choose
place
that's
being
very
fair
Its
a
pain
to
place
order
in
this
restaurant
First
of
all
their
service
is
very
slow
it
takes
forever
for
the
server
notice
u
and
take
your
order
When
finally
comes
table
its
struggle
make
them
understand
what
you
want
eat
restaurant
would
benefit
from
hiring
servers
who
can
communicate
English
After
long
day
at
work
dont
spend
20
mins
help
serer
Also
they
offer
little
room
customize
as
compared
other
Thai
restaurants
You
can't
how
spicy
curry
or
if
less
veggies
more
sauce
chicken
on
noodle
no
has
problem
my
knowledge
I
have
been
sitting
here
now
hasn't
served
us
water
yet
They
do
well
customer
feel
welcoming
Mediocre
pub
food
It
almost
met
my
expectations
but
the
ahi
appetizer
tasted
like
it
was
from
a
can
and
small
portion
too
The
boneless
wings
were
ok
pork
tenderloin

tender
Maybe
worth
3
stars
on
good
day
waitress
didn't
seem
alarmed
that
one
of
sautéed
peppers
had
grocery
sticker
it
Her
reaction
oh
sorry
I'll
tell
cook
And
then
what
Tell
him
to
cook
stickers
more
Worthless
reservation
system
Had
a
10:30am
appointment
with
Stella
and
arrived
at
10:25am
Someone
was
in
the
chair
but
near
end
finished
10:26am
took
another
customer
that
waiting
looked
me
comment
oh
you
are
my
10:30
want
take
long
Wasting
time
making
on
internet
then
wasting
again
by
doing
non-reservation
favor
is
beyond
what
I
can
comprehend
Why
may
not
be
able
to
impact
your
bottom
line
will
do
utmost
spread
experience
As
Eek
there
should
minus
stars
as
well
see
no
justification
being
given
even
one
star

Brandon
was
very
quick
on
responding
to
my
Yelp
email
him
He
constantly
in
contact
via
text
or
throughout
the
whole
process
from
initial
contact
quoting
arriving
day
of
and
finish
up
easy
work
with
professional
I
had
a
2
car
garage
worth
of
demolition
material
he
removed
day
contacted
few
other
Junk
Removal
companies
but
best
experience
Brandon
Would
recommend
him
for
any
future
need
great
breakfast
spot
especially
if
you
in
a
rush
this
worked
out
perfect
for
my
employees
and
i
before
our
convention
I
was
here
the
Monday
before
Xmas
and
then
again
for
NYE
Everything
as
always
fabulous
cannot
speak
highly
enough
about
flounder
with
root
vegetable
cake
almonds
golden
raisins

curry
beurre
blanc
would
drink
broth
bathe
in
it
do
all
sorts
of
obscene
things
its
that
good
tried
crispy
quail
lettuce
wrap
1st
time
it
another
stand
out
wish
had
sooner
Ramen
gnocchetti
were
both
good
always
There
a
lot
other
deliciousness
consumed
well
but
won't
list
everything
For
dessert
need
to
talk
freaking
amazing
pear
skillet
cake
served
avocado
ice
cream
salted
caramel
OMG
this
unreal
times
could
have
done
w/o
having
share
Needless
say
GFOM
is
still
holding
strong
one
my
faves
Charlotte
definitely
contributed
holiday
weight
gain
But
damn
worth
it
Atmosphere
is
very
unique
Very
cool
Beer
average
My
sesame
tuna
was
good
The
wife
had
jambalaya

oldest
ordered
the
ribs
excellent
youngest
Wagyu
steak
horrible
We
must
of
missed
part
on
menu
where
they
add
a
cilantro
pesto
sauce
to
it
family
doesn't
like
Cilantro
too
soapy
tasting
but
that
wasn't
even
issue
34
and
it
toughest
piece
medium-rare
I've
ever
eaten
I
can
cook
much
better
at
home
would
service
outstanding
I
came
to
Hand
and
Stone
the
day
before
my
wedding
this
past
June
for
first
time
ever
had
never
been
a
spa
anything
but
get
wax
done
so
was
little
nervous
going
in
because
have
extremely
sensitive
skin
When
into
location
greeted
by
super
nice
receptionist
who
gave
me
some
yummy
coconut
water
papers
fill
out
about
Deborah
later
took
room
would
treatment
She
sure
describe
everything
that
be
done
skin
intended
outcome
did
assessment
told
what
could
better
skin
totally
agreed
then
began
treatment
it
felt
AMAZING
only
bad
am
one
of
those
people
feel
awkward
silence
tried
keep
on
talking
confirmed
is
okay
not
talk
relax
After
moment
stop
talking
enlightened
calm
sad
when
over
loved
much
showed
really
glowing
treatment
went
products
used
more
water
also
samples
face
door
perfect
experience
spa
love
their
mission
plans
customers
will
continue
go
location
as
well
By
far
best
gift
card
ever
received
Oh
wow
This
place
has
been
around
for
over
10
years
I
know
the
changed
ownership
lately
but
quality
of
food
only
gone
down
a
little
bit
The
hicken
tenders
used
to
be
bigger
and
better
gripe
have
is
that
when
you
call
in
an
order
tack
extra
minutes
onto
whatever
they
told
you
Excellent
Small
town
dinner
Cool
50's
decor
and
I
like
that
they
have
a
counter
to
sit
at
Came
on
Thursday
morning
busy
but
no
wait
Food
was
excellent
made
order
had
the
breakfast
burrito
side
of
hash
browns
English
Muffin
Should
only
ordered
Burrito
it
huge
Everything
cooked
perfect
great
quality
Coffee
never
empty
server
friendly
fast
Defiantly
will
come
back
when
in
area
This
place
is
great
to
come
with
kids
or
even
on
a
date
I
have
taken
my
niece
twice
and
she
loves
this
place
They
so
many
different
types
of
fish
especially
for
being
located
in
mall
The
best
times
go
are
when
its
slow
during
the
week
we
went
once
weekday
weekend
it
gets
pretty
busy
activities
do
along
tour
it's
easier
navigate
not
chaotic
if
you
weekday
Overall
think
awesome
I'm
sure
I'll
be
taking
again
sometime
soon
We
stopped
by
here
on
our
last
day
looking
for
a
good
breakfast
spot
that
won't
break
the
bank
after
long
weekend
away
I
have
to
say
not
lot
of
places
around
in
Vegas
everyone
sleeps
late
this
was
definite
plus
Upon
entering
we
were
greeted
and
seated
right
The
menu
pretty
standard
American
breakfasts
makes
sense
place
is
called
America
prices
inexpensive
Las
Vegas
My
husband
ordered
all
you
can
eat
pancakes

but
as
scramble

large
plentiful
enjoyed
it
very
much
best
part

He
fantastic

while
here
manager

Kim

how

She

although
BIG
Patriots

perfect

felt
she
staff
needed
they
great
around
This
is
the
second
time
I
have
had
an
experience
like
below
went
there
today
to
pick
up
some
little
red
chilis
and
greens
Now
store
in
itself
good
it
has
a
large
selection
of
many
specialty
items
from
orient
The
problem
staff
wasn't
sure
which
leafy
green
vegetable
get
for
my
wife
so
naturally
attempted
ask
woman
chopping
sorting
vegetables
at
produce
area
politely
said
Excuse
me
pause
no
response
okay

asked
again
She
looked
me
as
if
done
her
terrible
injustice
then
she
spoke
any
English
shook
head
motioning
no
with
extremely
sour
look
on
face
So
proceed
another
woman
took
3
me's
even
response
Again
exact
same
gesture
WOW
ok
sorry
guess
should
learned
how
speak
Mandarin
or
Cantonese
before
shop
there
proceeded
hot
plate
area
serving
food
who
could
understand
English
help
best
way
that
could
Now
am
not
completely
ticked
majority
staff
doesn't
although
would
be
helpful
considering
fact
we
live
speaking
part
country
What
gets
attitude
received
customer
was
very
polite
they
were
rude
If
you
donta
speaka
language
don't
surprised
do
receive
help
The
service
was
excellent
we
had
Emily
as
our
server
She
very
pleasant
and
attentive
We
ordered
half
a
dozen
Gold
band
Oysters
Lump
Crab
Cocktail
two

My
dish
the
pan
roast
it
loaded
with
shells
taste
great
but
I
kept
crunching
down
on
shells
husband
Gumbo
looked
like
spanish
rice

Overall
food
could
use
some
attention
Excellent
Vietnamese
food
and
service
Clean
friendly
We
come
here
more
than
once
in
a
weekend
when
we
visit
Madison
Tasty
and
large
portions
Get
the
pecan
pie
for
dessert
too
Everyone
was
very
polite
great
vibes
Let's
face
it....I'm
a
band
geek
always
have
been
and
will
be
Nothing
can
compare
to
the
excitement
one
gets
when
walking
into
music
store
find
drum
kit
after
sitting
willing
ready
be
played
I
come
from
long
family
line
of
musician
so
my
brothers
came
visit
last
week
both
drummers
as
well
it's
no
wonder
we
found
our
selves
wandering
vast
expanse
that
has
Long

Naturally
all
headed

like
hungry

unsuspecting

All
tripping
over

in
hopes
getting
iron

annoying
around
us
with
nonstop
musical
array
double

Within
5
minutes
were
greeted
by
dreamy
stick
wielding
employee
who
let
test
drive
everything
could
possibly
get
grubby
fingers
on
The
extent
inventory
they
carry
is
borderline
ridiculous...anything
world
you
dream
here
After
good
3
hours
playing
decided
on
purchases
check
out
where
new
friend
and
his
ears
probably
only
too
happy

more
needs
to
be
said
had
the
philly
cheese
she
chicken
sandwich
both
were
really
good
definitely
give
them
a
try
We
wanted
a
quick
breakfast
during
our
move
and
found
this
place
to
be
delightful
The
people
working
there
were
super
nice
helpful
the
food
was
fabulous
ham

my

Coffee

So
I
came
here
with
family
and
friends
The
friends
son

Gigi

Thank

the

fantastic
started

Something
told
me
ask
how
many
there
would
be
waitress
went
kitchen
back
answer......5
You
have
be
fecking
kidding
me
1.40
per
Mussel....most
restaurants
serve
at
least
two
dozen

Thought
Shrimp

WHOLE

It's

I'm

they
weren't
worst
part
if
it
could
any
worse
my
sister
niece
had
wine
When
asked
another
glass
of
wine
brought
over
bottles
from
bar
refilled
their
glasses
table
Did
run
out
glasses
That
most
low
rent
thing
ever
seen
First
definitely
last
time
eat
anything
here
This
place
offers
one
of
the
best
different
styled
pastas
and
noodles
at
place
The
difference
between
regular
small
was
quite
insignificant
though
Going
with
size
your
favorite
choice
among
options
is
way
to
go
Do
you
remember
the
nasaly
slug-like
woman
from
Monsters
Inc
If
do
then
may
have
chance
to
see
her
real

counter
part
at
this
location
I
did
Things
go
well
if
comply
without
question
don't
ask
for
explanations
and
that
a
sense
of
humor
would
mark
an
employee
as
weak
human
so
expect
one
You
will
also
be
treated
like
member
French

so
brush

And
Yes

Following

I

A

spacious

The
people
at

are
lovely
There
lots
of
reasons
starting
with
the
fact
that
they
do
good
solid
glass
work
Also
kind
and
reasonable
when
it
comes
to
things

Great

I
was
in
town
for
a
girls
trip
so
happy
to
get
as
walk
not
pay
arm

Restaurant
was
really
empty
on
Saturday
for
lunch
We
sat
down
in
the
patio
area
that
wasn't
outside
just
outside
restaurant
I
had
fish
sandwich
and
clam
chowder
Then

Clam
chowder
first
People
my
party
thought
it
too
salty
I'd
have
to
say
saltiness
about
same
as
Campbell's
canned
soup
Other
than
that
pretty
standard
did
expect
be
blown
away
at
a
seafood
restaurant
but
wasn't
The

good
Just
though
ended
up

eat
fish
fries
were
alright
nothing
special
Reminded
me
of

fries
not
good
Ice

That's
probably
only
thing
stood
out
no
good
enough
finish

Good
try
wouldn't
come
again
They
told
me
they
are
the
3rd
Wave
of
coffee
houses
and
I
became
a
believer
I'm
sucker
for
hipster
trendy
sheet
metal
tables
industrial
looking
interior
However
what
really
matters
here
is
coffee
Simply
put
it's
best
I've
had
can't
even
explain
why
it
just
tasted
smoother
had
multiple
Dirty
Chai
Teas
from
them
Chai
with
an
expresso

added

All

off

I
love
that

No

in

had
semi-long

was
ok
with
that

the

make
it

it's
worth
it
Burrito
great

okay
But
meat

not

was
so
afraid
that

not
live
up
to
the

or
just
be

down
Could

Tryst
is
by

my
favourite
club
in
Vegas
I
have
only
been
to
a
handful
Tao
XS
Marquee
Lavo
but
out
of
those
this
has
the
most
enjoyable
The
first
time
went
with
group
5
girls
and
since
we
had
talked
promoter
Matt
he
walked
us
front
each
got
two
free
drink
tickets

yay
good
although
don't
remember
much
trip
anymore
second
time
came
a
couple
days
ago
9
people
girls
4
guys
Even
though
told
me
initially
that
boys
did
not
pay
was
there
talk
bouncers

clerks
so
ended
up
having
pay
20
dollars

mean
it's
HUGE
deal
just
unexpected
Again
2
After
everyone
in
little
irked
texted
who
guy
named
Adam
Farer
apparently
promotions
host
for
upstairs
managing
explained
situation
gave
6
more

Yay
That
easy
Since
drinks
are
15
it
worth
it
That's
storyyyy
guess
liked
because
aren't
as
dick-y
like
they
were
at
XS
or
anddd
small
enough
lose
any
friends
Tao
great
clubs
wayyyy
huge
and
get
lost

If
anyone
needs
help
getting
touch
Vegas
definitely
let
know
Your
will
run
smoothly
be

I
highly

I
know
it's
cruel

whenever

Such
was

today
when
traipsing

happened
upon

At

within
minutes
I
absolutely
loved
the
vibe
got
when
walked
into
this
place
And
beautiful
display
of
gelato
and
treats
made
me
drool
The
man
that
helped
us
out
was
very
friendly
we
ended
up
chit
chatting
for
a
bit
Tis

I'm

so
sure
you
can
guess

Absolutely

place
Can't

They

also
that

I'm

the
theme
this

Only

blocks
from
Fremont

minimalist

and

cheap

let

fool
you
once
inside
are
greeted
exposed
bricks

plenty
long
wooden
tables
So
it's
pretty
funky
an
unpretentious
way....not
something
can
be
said
very
often
about
Vegas
Don't
go
for
burgers
they
look

Keep

I
keep
thinking
about
the
brisket
hash
So
much
meat
savoury
and
a
with
side
of
spicy

this
is
gotta
be
my
ideal
breakfast

Add
in
crispy

you
have
real
winner
There's
attention
to

here
food

This
place
was
crowded
they
lost
our
reservation
but
it
only
time
I've
gone
so
I'll
give
them
pass
for
now
On

I

2
of

contracts
with
LVAC
since
moving
out
here
in
late
90's
did
it
once
2000
and
again
2006
After
that
would
renew
every
year
by
paying
advance
upfront
for
a
good
price
Well
December
2014
missed
expiration
deal
4
days
they
then
refused
to
honor
deal
When
called
customer
service"(the
Maryland
Parkway
location
pretty
much
had
tough
sh*t
attitude
about
whole
situation
They
said
my
only
options
were
a
3rd

contract(I
don't
think
so
or
b
wait
see
if
send
another
renewal
offer
The
representative
literally
told
me
just
keep
checking
mail
decided
extend
offer
again
Suffice
say
that
is
over
later
never
came
gyms
are
large
well
equipped
but
service
is
completely
pathetic
patiently
waited
ever
receive
any
kind
fair

No
First
off
you
have
to
be
aware
of
some
the
basics
how
gold
industry
works
Pay
attention
spot
price
and
ask
for
right
price
Gold
Buyers
are
a
business
like
any
other
when
don't
come
prepared
its
easy
get
taken
advantage
of
I'm
very
happy
say
with
much
confidence
that
Nevada
Coin
pays
highest
percentage
your
old
jewelry
Having
said
if
what
deal
getting
they
probably
will
make
little
extra
but
want
sell
it
this
is
best
shop
in
Vegas
This
Starbucks
is
always
crowded
both
inside
and
drive
thru
And
they
don't
seem
to
move
the
lines
quickly
Our
first
visit
to
Barrio
Cafe
and
we
LOVED
it
We
had
prompt
friendly
service
the
timing
of
was
spot
on
The
happy
hour
tacos
drinks
were
perfect
My
husband
tried
duck
very
pleased
I
preferred
halibut
Both
phenomenal
Next
will
have
save
room
for
dessert
Oh
did
mention
sangria
YUM
Absolutely
love
this
place
Everything
about
place
is
great
The
food
delicious
service
wonderful
the
prices
are
affordable
and
nice
clean
By
far
one
of
my
favorite
places
to
eat
Been
here
a
couple
times
because
their
boba
is
really
good
but
it's
not
worth
it
when
they
don't
have
good
customer
service
and
the
wait
time
about
20
minutes
One
day
took
10
minutes
just
for
someone
to
get
my
order
she
order
rest
of
people
behind
me
guess
what
mine
was
made
last
Very
upsetting
Probably
gonna
go
unless
friends/family
want
in
hurry
THE

Met
a
friend
for
lunch
here
I've
had
other
friends
rave
about
this
place
so
we
decided
to
try
it
First
of
all
is
one
the
rare
places
that
serves
my
favorite
Boddington's
Pub
Ale
on
tap
My
Gastropub
Burger
which
was
cooked
perfectly
and
looked
delicious
I
fish
chips
lightly
fried
tasted
very
fresh
Each
our
orders
came
with
fries
were
10
they
seemed
be
double
crunchy
The
service
attentive
but
not
obtrusive
All
in
it
perfect
meal
at
great
place
We
will
returning
I
would
like
to
give
them
4.5
stars
If
the
sushi
had
been
better
they'd
have
gotten
5-stars
So
skip
sushi
there's
lots
more
try
The
buffet
is
HUGE
It
has
9
stations
plus
a
dessert
island
I've
never
in
Vegas
that
comes
even
close
size
variety

quality
of
food
here
There's
everything
from
Mexican
Thai
Chinese
Vietnamese
and
more
tried
weird
cultural
goods
out
my
comfort
zone
they
were
all
good
Plus
true
favorites
course
only
photographed
about
50
what's
available
Oh
wish

smaller

But
it
was
great

I
stopped
there
for
lunch
we
both
had
tacos
She
the
fish
pork
So
hear
pork
taco
think
pulled
bbq
with
all
fixings
right
WRONG
was
presented
2
of
soggiest
soft
tacos
ever
encountered
But
soggy
exterior
not
most
offensive
part
took
one
bite
thought
that
server
got
my
order
wrong
The
inside
filled
cubes
greasy
fried
pork
to
myself
What
in
world
Oh
if
mushy
oily
texture
enough
an
insult
pallet
let
me
add
entire
bland
combination
left
speechless
grossed
out
came
around
see
how
things
were
going
told
him
expecting
different
experience
taco
He
asked
would
like
something
else
no
If
cook
could
destroy
as
simple
which
is
easy
make
sandwich
interested
anything
on
menu
Taylor
is
literally
the
best
bartender
I've
had
Best
drink,best
food
Mac
and
cheese
balls
Avocado
toast
Much
older
strip
hotel
but
still
seem
to
have
the
glitz
in
ruff
sparkle
We
wanted
check
it
out
since
was
within
our
tourist
view
and
found
brightness
of
decors
be
picturetaining
Inside
smelled
horrible
reeped
with
smoke..."YUCK

With
all
new
hotels
that
been
built
ones
progress
Neveda
should
really
tear
down
old
are
less
profitable
Sweet
Caroline
nope
The
dueling
piano
concept
is
lost
on
this
place
the
pianos
seem
tormented
by
their
player's
inability
to
hold
a
note
or
keep
tune
Been
few
of
these
places
and
one
awful
songs
are
stale
nobody
normal
wants
hear
sweet
caroline
place
had
decent
sized
crowd
that
was
not
very
enthusiastic
Wouldnt
reccomend
unless
you
drunk
extremely
tone
deaf
Saw
this
place
pop
up
on
Yelp
and
had
to
try
it
out
I
love
Indian
food
When
you
walk
in
will
find
a
large
open
restaurant
The
cups
dishes
are
very
traditional
of
an
There
is
array
items
their
menu
They
have
vegetation
non-vegetation
options
we
went
put
order
go
they
offered
water
gave
us
small
desert
while
waited
for
our
It
was
so
good
service
here
amazing
Everyone
does
great
job
really
make
feel
at
home
when
come
in
ton
parking
right
out
front
No
need
park
far
away
want
everything
the
menu
sauces
that
get
with
your
food
good
as
well
complement
dishes
recommend
everyone
amazing
authentic
love
I
have
purchased
pretty
much
every
stitch
of
my
western
wear
wardrobe
here
My
cowboots
From
Lammles
cowboy
hats
very
nice
looking
shirts
I've
bought
books
here
jeans
bolo
ties
AM
A
FAN
Every
time
that
enter
this
store
am
greeted
in
a
friendly
manner
There
are
always
enough
staff
on
hand
to
help
me
out
especially
love
the
service
from
Michelle
bubbly
complimenting
gal
I'm
first
name
basis
with
most
staff
but
if
Michelle
is
working
she's
one
going
be
helping
me
So
you
want
tremendous
service
selection
and
hospitality
shop
here
This
store
is
awesome
The
management
great
the
employees
are
friendly
and
Kelly
in
salon
ALWAYS
does
an
amazing
job
on
my
hair
I
would
100
recommend
this
location/salon
Great
cuts
of
meat
clean
great
ambience
and
music
service
is
pretty
quick
once
you
order
they
much
bring
everything
out
fairly
quickly
Definitely
go
with
the
Korean
Prime
Kalbi
I
wish
had
japchae
as
part
appetizers
GRILLED
PEPPERS
WERE
THE
BEST
Also
do
yourself
a
favor
Lychee
Calpico
Soda
it's
nectar
gods....or
at
least
pagan
gods
The
could
be
attentive
though
Had
to
wait
until
end
meal
get
my
first
water
refill
it
wasn't
even
busy
Come
here
for
food
not
service
My
family
and
I
ate
our
Thanksgiving
dinner
early
around
12pm

We
decided
we
wanted
to
take
a
spontaneous
trip
somewhere
so
on
Las
Vegas

live
in
cal
started
checking
prices
Expedia
came
across
Hooters
being
the
cheapest
closer
strip
It
was
60
night
The
hotel
is
as
nice
clean
They
also
have
great
customer
service
here
isn't
like
5
star
it's
just
simple
hotel
has
Keurig
although
coffee
cups
thingys
tasted
old
But
overall
good
stay
better
than
motel

I've
read
up
on
a
lot
of
shoe
repair
places
and
was
very
picky
in
choosing
where
to
get
my
two
pair
boots
fixed
Both
needed
new
rubber
thing
under
the
heels
zipper
replacement
one
them
I
afraid
things
being
overcharged
them
loosing
stuff
This
place
is
old-school
type
that
likely
wont
be
around
much
longer
as
Gino
pretty
old
He's
sweet
man
who
only
runs
shop
His
service
prompt
and
you
can
call
him
make
sure
it's
ready
before
coming
if
he
might
running
late
thought
going
pay
way
more
than
25
it
all
fixed
wouldn't
go
anywhere
else
These
cobbler

dying
skill
So
I'm
glad
have
had
gino's
service
It
would
have
gotten
more
stars
if
it
opened
at
10:00
instead
of
10:15
Who
opens
15
minutes
before
a
movie
starts
doesn't
give
people
enough
time
to
get
popcorn
and
their
seats
Really
cool
place
they
got
great
selection
of
pet
accessories
and
food
discovery

I
recently
a
kitty
for
the
first
time
gentleman
who
works
there
maybe
he's
owner
also
gave
me
so
many
tips
advices
Strongly
recommended
As
a
new
LV
resident
and
someone
who
works
right
near
this
location
I
REALLY
hoped
place
would
be
awesome
but
was
really
disappointed
with
the
experience
Brought
my
two
buddies
here
after
assuring
them
it
awesome
based
on
reviews
Saturday
night
around
8
not
too
crowded
We
had
waitress
though
very
nice
largely
absent
seating
us
When
our
food
order
arrived
we
spent
about
5
minutes
waiting
and
later
searching
for
her
because
1
no
plates
2
silverware
3
wrong
explained
that
ordered
nachos
tomatoes
or
onions
which
were
all
over
nachos
she
asked
if
wanted
to
send
back
don't
WANT
back
need
back
in
party
can't
do
those
items
begrudgingly
abliged
No
apology
nothing
The
first
only
thing
should
have
been
an
apology
offer
replace
clear
order
eventually
brought
plates
they
soaking
wet
as
out
g
washer
wipe
down
good
service
just
RUINED
experience
am
longer
according
buddies
allowed
pick
where
go
eat

that's
how
bad
was
damn
Edit
2nd
time
much
better
Granted
me
at
bar
tender
attentive
great
will
come
hopefully
add
another
star
or
2
My
happy
place
I
have
been
to
multiple
fitness
studios
and
gyms
throughout
Vegas...Gyms
CrossFit
Yoga
Pilates
etc
Redemption
Fitness
offers
amazing
High
Intensity
Interval
Training
REP
classes
are
always
different
kick
my
ass
make
me
feel
amazing
They
incredible
high
energy
RIDE
that
can't
get
enough
of
REBEL
for
those
who
love
boxing
Incredible
studio
staff
By
far
the
best
place
train
in
Vegas
‍‍
Holy
hell
was
this
amazing
When
our
friend
recommended
place
he
described
the
food
quite
accurately
I
believe
description
went
something
like
this
I
won't
lie
to
you
it's
basically
fancy
hot
pockets
But
they're
really
good
unique
and
fresh
We
took
his
word
we're
glad
Flavors
came
through
very
well
in
appetizers
entrees
desserts
had
Italian
pasty
A
variety
of
meats
cheese
tomatoes
with
marinara
dip
into
finished
full
but
still
wanted
more
wide
beer
also
present
There
were
two
downfalls
my
mind
The
first
that
main
source
light
a
candle
at
each
table
would
have
enjoyed
seeing
tablemates
bit
better
as
food
second
no
removal
ingredients
aspect
although
wasn't
looking
exclude
any
ingredients
from
specific
pasty
pasties
are
made
large
batches
then
refrigerated
until
they
cooked
Items
chunks
though
so
if
remove
on
own
could
with
more
light
course
If
you're
for
different
type
meal
area
stop
in
Just
happened
to
check
in
on
yelp
and
they
offered
a
free
drink
Sweet
right
Not
so
much
Jump
down
turn
around
pick
bale
of
cotton
then
you
might
get
that
Food
was
pretty
good
waiter
helpful
From
the
moment
you
walk
in
can
sense
that
this
is
real
deal
and
are
in
for
a
treat
We
were
greeted
by
David
Zaltzman
general
manager
shown
to
lovely
table
personally
assisted
him
personifies
hospitality
industry
professionals
Everything
at
Montreal
institution
top-notch
while
expensive
reasonable
quality
service
ambiance
portion
size
we
ordered
from
caesar
salad
salmon
tartare
rib
eye
onion
strips
grilled
asparagus
was
more
than
enough
two
maybe
three
diners
Don't
miss
cole
slaw
I
have
tried
buy
slaw
US
but
apparently
not
available
Moishes
what
steak
houses
use
be
sadly
no
more
Other
perhaps
Peter
Luger's
NYC
may
best
house
experienced
about
40
years
Obviously
natives
agree
judging
crowds
families
celebrating
special
occasions
or
just
enjoying
being
together
Our
daughter
Boston
recommended
it
so
glad
she
did
Why
hasn't
this
been
reviewed
yet
This
place
is
THE
for
choco-addicts
The
best
I'm
talking
major
scrumpa-lumptious
It's
one
of
my
favorite
gifts
to
send
Also
good
custom
corporate
gifts
My
fav
a
hard
one...how
about
top
4...raspberry
swirl
peanut
butter
coconut
and
mint
chocolate
I
only
gave
it
1
star
so
could
write
this
review
This
place
is
a
joke
to
the
learning
system
They
are
drastically
understaffed
some
classes
have
much
as
30
kids
for
one
teacher
My
child
grew
fond
on
teacher
and
she
left
establishment
because
was
constantly
not
getting
paid
Which
isn't
hard
believe
since
they
often
lost
payments
from
parents
regular
The
front
desk
girls
unprofessional
illiterate
lady
who
promoted
an
office
can't
remember
her
name
heavy
set
white
woman
has
be
stupidest
in
building
smh
advise
you
waste
single
dollar
especially
your
money
going
teachers
but
it's
fat
pockets
This
is
unique
fun
and
a
great
way
to
be
kid
again
It
little
pricey
but
I
thought
it
was
worth
would
do
again
The
video
educational
really
makes
you
appreciate
what
takes
in
nature
for
all
these
amazing
species
survive
room
with
the
cocoons
neat
actually
see
some
emerging
at
times
actual
butterfly
pavilion
amazing
So
many
beautiful
butterflies
they
land
right
on
peaceful
Then
have
small
exhibit
bees
ants
scorpions
etc
They
try
sell
picture
ours
came
out
so
we
got
as
fun
souvenir
go
back
maybe
once
every
six
months
something
different
do
I
live
in
the
neighborhood
and
quit
doing
business
with
this
place
for
a
number
of
reasons
including
wrong
orders
rudeness
pizza
that
tasted
canned
sauce
cold
food
was
looking
close
hoagie
my
usual
has
been
slipping.So
looked
up
reviews
found
Franks
were
pretty
good
so
tried
them
again
glad
did
had
cheese
w/mushrooms
an
Italian
hoagie
The
on
pie
slowed
cooked
flavor
really
good
quality
meats
great
bread
did
love
their
Buffalo
chicken
past
am
going
to
keep
trying
place
prices
are
little
higher
than
other
places
but
if
food
qulity
holds
out
don't
mind
paying
more
This
is
update
Had
buffalo

ok
not
as
past
Not
lot
or
cheese
They
still
have
awesome
ranch
dip
it

This
pharmacy
sucks
Every
time
I
come
here
the
employees
are
standing
around
talking
and
only
one
person
Dot
is
working
The
bad
thing
about
it
they
see
line
make
eye
contact
still
stand
there
talking
Went
in
on
a
Saturday
night
and
was
seated
immediately
This
place
surprisingly
not
busy
at
all
We
were
greeted
served
super
fast
started
with
the
hush
puppies
that
came
out
cute
little
basket
They
could
have
been
fried
tad
bit
longer
as
they
still
mushy/mealy
inside
but
overall
good
Then
we
ordered
sliders
Again
fast
is
good
choice
you
want
to
try

Lastly

Great
food
always
fresh
and
hot
Very
fast
service
Not
a
fan
of
the
egg
drop
soup
or
Mongolian
beef
but
everything
else
is
fantastic
Best
place
in
area
by
far
Always
consistent
always
great
donuts
and
service
Sometimes
fancy
are
complicated
over
done
to
cover
up
for
an
inferior
product
These
good
old
fashioned
consistently
superior
donuts
Try
the
latest
fad
but
come
back
here
tried
true
I
just
moved
to
Las
Vegas
from
Nashville
where
worked
out
at
a
small
24/7
gym
While
almost
anything
would
have
been
better
than
what
was
used
to
in
many
large
gyms
and
overall
this
one
beats
any
gym
trained
HANDS
DOWN
Not
only
are
you
surrounded
by
community
of
fit
fam

those
surrounding
professional
bodybuilders
or
even
Olympians
As
bikini
bodybuilder
is
such
motivation
for
me
work
alone
don't
hands
on
personal
trainer
I'm
not
part
big
rah
team
so
really
needed
BOOST
as
head
into
my
2016
season
Weights
machines
ENDLESS
when
it's
busy
never
find
yourself
waiting
too
long
get
the
equipment
want
use
They
much
offer
can
always
substitute
The
staff
polite
remembered
name
after
ONE
visit
take
time
welcome
you
ask
how
for
me
our
move
going
etc
very
helpful
I've
also
had
several

introduce
themselves
tell
doing
great

their

Cant
test

It
an
additional
fee
but
sure
worth
it
The
floor
mats
fit
perfectly
and
I
saved
on
shipping
by
picking
them
up
myself
Went
here
for
a
friends
birthday
and
it
was
great
We
sampled
couple
appetizers
one
of
the
flatbreads
burger
All
were
delicious
It
quite
busy
at
our
reservation
time
6:30pm
on
Thursday
so
I'd
suggest
making
if
you're
going
during
normal
dining
hours
Bonus
tip
If
you
sign
up

can

Will
be
back
sure
Wanted
to
use
my
Groupon
and
they
were
closed
for
renovation
Not
sure
how
long
that
will
last
but
you
may
want
call
first
if
are
thinking
of
going
soon
Will
update
when
I
can
actually
go
This
place
is
amazing
Everything
we
ordered
was
so
good
Delivery
super
fast
Prices
were
fair
and
the
menu
has
good
choices
I
will
definitely
be
going
back
to
this
over
over
You
walk
into
Rhum
Corner
and
feel
like
you
are
transported
to
another
place
while
there's
no
sand
on
the
floor
almost
there
would
be
It's
a
squishy
intimate
space
that
serves
up
best
drinks
my
personal
fave
is
their
Dark
Stormy
version
with
great
selection
And
food
The
food
Makes
me
so
happy
especially
WHOLE
FISH
for
2
fried
perfectly
comes
rice
okra
plantain
fills
right
up
Literally
don't
eat
anything
before
come
day
Or
drink
anything
Overall
I
haven't
wanted
write
review
this
spot
because
then
be
giving
away
one
of
Toronto's
kept
secrets
Oh
staff
fun

professional
will
leave
feeling
family
Just
had

No

I
had
a
delicious

are
quite
pricey

worked
for
me
Good

delicious
Price

Service

Went

for
brunch
on
Christmas
Eve
Price

Only
took
us
about
15
minutes
to
be
seated
Thought
this
a
really
good

Loved
all
the
prepared
small
plates
Some
of
my
favorites
were

and
mash
spicy
Mac

cheese
salmon
with
topping
fresh
squeezed
juice
The
desserts
also
good
Had
peppermint
cheesecake
banana

The

little
weird
asked

Nice
place
to
shop
especially
in
the
warmer

walking

Good

The

We

The

This
place
is
really
good
for
dinner
and
not
so
lunch
despite
having
special
I
suspect
they
have
different
chef
because
even
when
we
order
our
favorite
meals
don't
taste
as
at
dinner
The
spices
are
right
some
flavors
lacking
the
texture
different
Trust
me

we've

didn't
wait
until
take

Headed
out
to
the
Jerk
last
night
for
a
bite
with
girlfriend
before
concert
My
past
experiences
here
have
been
incredibly
slow
service
and
so-so
food
Maybe
because
of
recent
eviction
scare
or
maybe
they
just
found
their
groove
again
was
great
Service
is
still
very
much
on
Caribbean
time
so
when
are
busy
you
might
wait
place
your
order
but
once
it's
in
set
Drinks
came
fast
ordered
did
food
and...it

Many
negative
most
having
do
with
negative
rude
and
unprofessional
attitude
from
one
of
stylists
Jessica
I
wrote
a
review
about
how
was
treated
by
her
owner
business
had
nerve
get
Yelp
say
my
fake
Interesting
then
guess
women
who
also
Jessica's
poor
customer
service
were
fake
You
would
think
be
more
concerned
why
customers
complaining
1
stylist
rather
than
trying
criticize
people
for
expressing
their
opinions
they
treated
may
been
able
recover
some
these
tried
Instead
it
appears
totally
comfortable
losing
potential
business
Ridiculous
Mr
Lockout
wasn't
able
to
help
me
in
my
particular
quirky
lockout
scenario
but
they
were
EXTREMELY
helpful
helping
find
someone
who
could
That's
the
real
test
for
a
company
how
treat
you
even
if
aren't
going
make
money
off
of
you
Was
craving
pupusas
and
the
Salvadorean
restaurants
in
Phoenix
are
scarce
but
luckily
best
is
close
to
my

Boyfriend
I
each
got
order
of

it
comes
with
a

beans
for
7.99
Neither

could
eat
third

so
we
have
pupusa
later
enjoyment
The

here
was
awesome
They
warmly

Will

Will
defiantly
come
back

of
service
received
As
far
as
food
quality
goes
it
is
a
typical
L&L
I
have
never
had
bad
experience
with
their
food
But
the
reason
why
like
this
one
so
much
that
they
always
remember
me
Every
time
go
in
ask
me
which
of
my
usual
items
will
be
picking
up
today
I'm
pretty
predictable
favorites
They
if
its
just
today
or
am
for
wife
also
They
her
favorites
well
So
me
to
Hawaiian
BBQ
spot
understand
people
say
they're
better
more
traditional
spots
but

welcoming

keep
coming

The
customer

was
excellent
This
is
definitely
a
sports
bar/restaurant
I
overwhelmed
by
how
many

expensive
Customer
poor
employees
did
not
look
happy
there
No
one
smiling
no
wished

They
just
didn't

that
care

Awesome
food
great
service
and
some
of
the
best
hot
wings
in
Vegas
I'm
100
satisfied
I
recommend
this
place
to
anyone
visiting
Las
Plus
awesome
prices
for
any
budget
I
purchased
a
bouquet
from
here
and
unfortunately
found
the
quality
to
be
poor
Being
that
their
product
is
more
premiumly
priced
you
expect
high
was
quite
small
died
following
day
even
with
proper
care
purchase
flowers
all
time
likely
would
not
go
back
here
Disappointing
Free

all
you
can

Damn
C'mon

Came
over
but
insisted
to
change
the

which
did
not
look
like
it
was
needed
Charged

The

only
needed

Wanted
my
a1
guy
quickly
took
his
truck
I
called
tell
management
and
he
says
would
investigate
never
back
call
them
again
I
went
here
to
the
movie
theater
wanted
see
what
all
hype
was
with
luxury
seating
Walking
through
casino
is
a
maze
signs
that
give
wrong
directions
Employees
seem
tired
and
short
customers
At
theater
The
ticket
counter
opened
just
5
minutes
before
my
started

missed
upcoming
attractions
bummed
actually
like
movies
will
be
coming
out
shortly
concessions
have
become
more
fast
food
restaurant
offering
everything
from
pizza
hotdogs
hamburgers
popcorn
candy
even
ice
cream
prices
are
quite
inflated
you
aren't
allowed
bring
in
anything
outside
If
spend
lot
for
pizza
beer
you'll
love
it
includes
new

of
alcoholic
drinks
leather

I'm
not
fan
won't

Not
bad
but
over
priced
for
what
you
get
I
have
only
been
2x's
within
a
year
and
was
little
disappointed
went
lunch
last
April
it
hard
to
find
something
light
on
the
menu
just
dinner
ordered
honey
mustard
glazed
salmon
It
ok
nothing
special
20.00
Probably
would
not
go
again
Food
was
okay
everything
kinda
bland
The
best
thing
at
this
place
is
the
sushi
Don't
try
lychee
martini
tasted
like
crap
also
FYI
worst
service
EVER
Always
a
great
experience
when
I
come
Bar
tenders
are
the
sweetest,Ashley
mostly
helped
us
always
fun
and
chicken
fingers
loaded
nachos
yum
It
was
pretty
good
The
place
is
adorable
and
it
feels
like
really
in
Mexico
All
the
customers
seemed
to
be
happy
there
I
do
want
try

our

I
highly
recommend

Well
I
went
there
for
dinner
after
seeing
a
recommendation
online
and
honestly
it
was
ok
Now
love
fried
foods
but
in
this
case
is
little
breading
heavy
Fries
coleslaw
were
perfect
along
with
the

had
My
only
problems
fish

To
me
halibut
even
though
it's
fresh
just
isn't
frying

Couple
that
heavy
wasn't
good
The

used
are
good
though
As

you
get

amazing
I'll
most
likely
be
back
to
try
place
again
months
All
I
remembered
was
hungry
ate
some
poutine
with
meat
inside
happy
didn't
line
up
or
went
inside
because
needed
fresh
air
now
finally
have
a
taste
of
the
at
Resto
La
Banquise
it
quite
walk
back
to
metro
station
had
something
drink
Why
my
photos
all
blurry
Meh
is
right....Never
mind
the
renovations
that
make
it
look
like
an
even
dingier
bar
than
before
in
my
humble
opinion
I
also
think
food
has
been
steadily
going
downhill
for
past
6
years
or
so
Ordered
burgers
to
go
with
extra
aoli
sauce
Did
not
get
i
asked
for
No
cutlery
was
provided
They
failed
mention
fries
were
half
sweet
potato
which
am
fond
of
KNOW
could
have
gotten
regular
but
forgot
A
reminder
would
nice
Also
staff
always
seems
SO
bored
Or
you
are
one
lucky
bastard
them
as
a
server
smiles
any
attempt
at
friendliness
Whatever
I'll
most
likely
go
back
just
due
location
whatever
won't
be
excited
I
have
eaten
here
several
times
even
before
the
name
change
and
although
food
is
good
service
horrible
find
pricey
but
none
less
continued
to
eat
here
today
last
time
placed

My

Best

I
tried
My
Thai
for
the
first
time
just
over
a
year
ago
Absolutely
consistently
delicious
favorite
so
far
is
Chili
Fried
Rice
It
comes
with
plenty
of
chicken
but
like
to
order
extra
and
hot
spice
level
So
good
Although
do
carry
out
have
enjoyed
dining
in
when
possible
Very
cute
clean
place
delightful
ambiance
Easily
my
restaurant
Cleveland
The
service
is
exceptional
I
bought
a
Elantra
from
David
Shafir
and
he
was
very
patient
knowledgable
am
satisfied
with
the
overall
provided
took
his
time
to
tell
me
everything
need
know
about
car
He
also
gave
good
deal
Now
excited
have
nice
ride
my
new
highly
recommend
this
dealership
if
you
are
looking
get
yourself
either
or
used
This
is
our
favorite
restaurant
in
Charlotte
Absolutely
outstanding
food
excellent
variety
service
and
fair
prices
It
does
get
crowded
they
don't
take
reservations

but
it
worth
the
wait
We
almost
always
mussels
a
green
curry
delicious
Other
consistent
favorites
are
crispy
quail
lettuce
wraps
scallops
falafel
The
menu
changes
fairly
often
so
there's
something
new
atmosphere
cooly
casual
it's
just
great
space
which
to
enjoy
food
expertly
served
Very
friendly
drive
through
The
breakfast
sandwhich
is
huge
You
can
tell
that
the
egg
freshly
cracked
sausage
tastes
fresh
too
Give
this
place
a
try
you
wont
be
dissapointed
is
eva
longoria
really
the
owner
of
eve
that's
what
i
heard
someone
needs
to
tell
her
that
go-go
dancers
are
supposed
DANCE
and
not
do
two
step
while
looking
like
they
don't
want
be
there

also
thought
it
was
a
little
weird
we
got
three
different
prices
for
bottle
goose
need
get
their
right
aside
bad
entertainment
shotty
prices
did
enjoy
this
club
music
pretty
good
it's
good
size
amount

dance
floor
has

friendly
my
friends
had

which
close

always

us
some
football
player
kind
party
fun
times
about
an
hour
before
left
announced
jabbawockeez
were
house
i
swear
didn't
see
them
though
conclusion
even
though
probably
6
out
10
asians
there
time
because
after
all
matter
where
you
are
but
rather
who
you're
with
right

This
sushi
place
definitely
isn't
what
it
used
to
be
customer
service
wise
Since
the
new
management
their
hours
changed
so
they
close
earlier
now
Last
call
is
at
11
don't
go
within
last
few
of
closing
because
it'll
really
bad
service
We
went
around
10:45
and
we
didn't
get
anyone
take
or
orders
got
no
straws
waiter
was
rushing
us
he
even
spilled
our
water
bother
clean
up
They
messed
up
orders
tried
bring
more
rolls
than
asked
when
asked
for
straws
gave
attitude
about
handed
one
single
straw
both
needed
them
Our
a
talker
asian
guy
with
big
square
glasses
on
chubbier
side
I
wouldn't
recommend
this
anymore
Definitely
better
places
in
town
lot
When
wanted
pay
waited
long
time
someone
check
all
employees
were
too
busy
focusing
closing
We've
been
coming
location
years
management
just
cutting
us
Not
worth
money
This
is
my
new
go
to
for
Chinese
delivery
I
had
been
ordering
elsewhere
because
the
meals
were
1
or
so
less
expensive
but
decided
to
give
Saigon
88
a
try
and
it
was
worth
it
Delivery
sushi
always
bad
idea
got
salmon
roll
white
tuna
sashimi
enjoyed
them
both
also
combination
lo
mein
hubby
cashew
chicken
Everything
very
good
only
reason
I'm
giving
4
stars
instead
of
5
took
an
hour
get
here
wait
First
time
flying
American
airlines
and
we
are
very
disappointed
We
arrived
2
hours
ahead
of
our
boarding
time
sat
at
gate
only
to
miss
flight
because
the
was
changed
were
told
if
any
changes
made
would
be
notified
but
received
nothing
now
have
sit
here
for
3
more
before
can
leave
change
whole
itinerary
due
this
delay
NOT
happy
flyers
Was
staying
on
the
strip
and
was
really
craving
steak
Of
course
everything
within
vicinity
like
at
least
50
for
tiny
ass
lil
steak
not
inclusive
of
sides
Did
some
research
in
tourist
magazines
found
this
affordable
house
about
15-20
minutes
away
from
strip
but
his
place
is
amazing
Although
we
paid
30's
our
meal
my
prime
rib
huge
Not
to
mention
it
came
with
a
giant
baked
potato
Salad
great
definitely
had
leftovers
The
nice
thing
casual
so
you
don't
feel
your
trying
be
all
fake
fancy
other
places
strip
Sam's
town
evening
entertainment
their
lightshow
good
time
walkoff
that
filling
delicious
meal
I
will
back
when
I'm
vegas
again
Let
me
start
by
saying
that
we
really
enjoy
a
burger
here
if
it
is
done
correctly
With
said

every
time
come
they
ask
want
pink
or
no

say
and
get
well
over
cooked
burger
This
all
after
waiting
30
min
for
our
food
to
out
in
the
first
place
It's
not
like
has
happened
only
1-2
times
Our
server
was
nice
but
sooooo
slow
Asked
speak
manager
he
didn't
care
about
anything
He
offered
remake
burgers
as
should
have
place

Overall
stellar
anymore
Unfortunately
quality
changed
worse
Only
reason
I
ever
went
back
is
because
was
staying
st
the
rio
This
place
not
good
The
food
mediocre
they
just
serve
huge
portions....and
you
pay
for
it
65
breakfast
Not
worth
it
It's
early
for
me
to
give
a
full
review
here
as
I've
just
been
in
couple
times
but
the
bartender
Dave
is
real
professional
Attentive
knowledgable
and
courteous
I'm
tired
of
these
other
joints
with
punk
ass
kids
where
you've
got
beg
drink
has
kept
my
drink
full
Now
if
I
could
win
some
damn
money
Oh
yeah
good
machines
reasonable
payouts
They're
terrible
Be
very
careful
You
will
MOST
LIKELY
end
up
paying
two
loans
and
you
get
zero
answers/communication
from
them
Go
certified
Trust
me
when
I
say
this
Gotta
say
I'm
a
vet
skeptic
This
place
has
never
failed
to
make
me
feel
like
I
was
not
getting
ripped
off
even
little
bit
Very
trust
worthy
For
as
long
I've
lived
here
this
is
only
the
second
time
been
here
Highly
recommended
for
80s
arcade
games
Pool
was
not
built
on
time
as
promised
Every
step
painful
with
us
having
to
call
get
answers
of
what
going
Sales
manager
and
construction
need
be
more
detailed
expectations
the
process
Would
recommend
using
this
company
unless
you
build
in
winter
dont
care
when
it
gets
done
itself
is
fine
expected
for
we
paid
I
went
in
to
buy
meat
grill
All
looked
really
dry
and
decided
get
seasoned
chicken
was
assured
the
would
be
moist
It
terrible

less
than
impressed
with
what
saw
result
proved
such
Horrible
experience
And
when
I
asked
to
speak
the
manager
complain
he
was
very
rude
and
unhelpful
False
advertising
on
their
website
definitely
expected
more
from
such
a
nice
hotel
I
love
this
bank
They
are
super
friendly
to
me
and
my
family
We
come
in
once
a
week
as
regulars
it's
always
an
out
along
with
great
costumer
service
I've
had
bad
experience
at
other
banks
felt
they
were
setting
up
for
failure
cheated
fees
every
time
everything.I've
been
us
bank
4
years
now
seriously
can't
say
enough
I
had
a
cracked
window
in
my
house
SR
Glass
provided
me
quote
via
email
based
on
description
They
were
quick
to
come
out
and
do
their
own
measurements
get
real
quote
It
took
about
week
for
them
make
match
the
existing
100
The
installer
came
out
30
minutes
new
was
in
Couldn't
even
tell
it
replacement
perfect
would
highly
recommend
anybody
needing
work
done
I
am
a
huge
pizza
fanatic
I've
probably
eaten
at
over
40
different
places
in
Vegas
I've
lived
here
for
25
years
This
place
have
the
best
stuff
town
If
you
like
Chicago
style,the
ones
are
pretty
good
too
The
reason
i
only
gave
it
4
stars
is
because
their
regular
crust
ok,but
style
and
stuffed..are
truly
to
die
for
Worst
club
experience
I've
ever
had
There
was
no
one
servicing
the
bar
music
way
to
loud
and
DJ
or
whoever's
job
it
get
people
on
dance
floor
just
stood
stage
did
nothing
almost
there
at
11
pm
a
Friday
night
so
they
probably
need
new
promoter
And
few
who
were
refused
dance
felt
like
junior
high
school
dance
This
is
my
favorite
kosher
restaurant
in
all
of
Phoenix
The
location
small
yet
comfy
and
the
food
takes
a
while
to
make
but
it's
so
worth
it
knowing
your
fresh
Huge
fan
spinach
cheese
ravioli
Overall
great
quality
This
is
the
absolute
worst
flying
experience
I've
ever
experienced
A
friend
of
mine
booked
all
my
travel
details
for
me
and
I
found
out
it
was
American
Airlines
which
never
flown
before
Our
Flight
delayed
4
hours
due
to
scheduling
conflict
Meaning
flight
attendants
were
not
scheduled
To
add
insult
injury
many
us
are
missing
our
connecting
flights
other
destinations
In
this
day
age
where
technology
at
fingertips
one
would
hope
level
incompetence
be
avoided
But
yet
here
we
are
StillDelayed
Flight1808
AASucks
I
have
tried
this
place
multiple
times
in
California
so
kind
of
expect
the
same
from
here
This
is
an
AYCE
All
You
Can
EAT
KBBQ
restaurant
where
you're
able
to
choose
A1
or
A2
your
selections
includes
some
side
dishes
and
salad
which
are
refillable
with
meal
The
meat
quality
great
service
as
well
a
bit
smaller
than
other
location
but
will
do
Horrible

I
love
the
food
but
Roath

is
most
rude

Terrible
Bought

Poor

Skip

This
was
my
first
time
getting
sugared
and
I
prefer
it
much
better
than
a

think
the
spreading
if
sugar
paste
more
painful
pulling
off
There
were
few
areas
that
clenched
on
but
didn't
tear
up
at
all
When

watered

love
fact
that
all

notice
disappointed
looks
on
people's
faces
as
they
got
their
food
The
burritos
looked
tiny
tortilla
wraps
were
pale
bland
It
also
like
tortillas
weren't
even
warmed
up
so
when
it
folded
into
burrito
started
fall
apart
Having
ignored
that
red
flag
decided
persevere
our
in
much
same
condition
cold
cheese
wasn't
melted
There
very
little

less

better
Still

Food

completely
unacceptable
This

but
overall
they

upon

top
notch
Been
coming
to
this
restaurant
for

Friday

but
they
moved
everyone
along

we
had
to

Very
nice

too
I
go
here
for
lunch
at

once
a
week
then
have
the
leftovers
next

making
it
worth
extra
cost
Good

lots
of

truly
decadent
mac

Service
is
always
top
notch
One
thing
my
parents
esp
father
used
say..."if
you
see
a
lot
of
older
folks
at
bar
or
restaurant
know
its
good
This
place
all
around
great
Excellent
experience
especially
for
a
body
shop
Everybody
was
very
nice
and
quick
to
help
I
am
selling
my
Jeep
needed
little
work
done
before
sold
it
Not
only
did
they
help
me
resecure
the
fenders
on
at
VERY
reasonable
price
but
Addison
spent
least
half
hour
explaining
how
refinish
them
inexpensively
exactly
what
he
recommended
it
looks
great
It
brand
new
His
advice
directly
resulted
in
getting
thousands
more
vehicle
This
shop
has
earned
loyalty
will
recommend
anybody
needing
any
work
I
got
my
door
with
some
issues
but
called
A1
Garage
Door
and
they
came
same
day
it
was
a
very
good
experience
The
people
on
the
office
accommodating
needs
tech
professional
awesome
service
will
recommend
to
friends
family
use
them
Five
start
quality
I
like
this
place
and
think
it
is
one
of
the
better
Madison
Thai
restaurants
though
other
location
on
University
more
consistent
Had
take
out
only
dish
was
memorable
Still
it's
my
go
to
when
am
visiting
parents
west
side
town
We
had
a
fantastic
meal
here
are
Lotus
of
Siam
lovers
but
couldn't
get
table
there
This
is
much
nicer
more
relaxed
room
than
Lotus
Great
service
great
interesting
thai
food
and
insane
desserts
LOVED
IT
A
definite
stop
when
I'm
in
Vegas
I've
been
here
on
my
last
3
trips
to
Vegas
and
never
disappointed
The
meat
is
extremely
juicy
tasty
the
toppings
are
delicious
What
we've
tried

Carne
asada
fries
Delicious
carne
insanely
tender
so
these
fries
a
lot
more
satisfying
than
back
home
tacos
I
love
that
tacos
come
with
guac
pico
de
gallo
Lengua
My
favorite
lengua
best
here
So
tender
Spicy
pork
like
creamy
sauce
compliments
meat
And
of
course
tastyyyy
Yum
Overall
really
fact
sauces
all
different
for
each
type
tried
Free
refills
drinks
which
includes
horchata

Mmmm
Awful
dealership
Their
price
listed
on
autotrader
and
their
own
website
is
about
3k
below
msrp
which
what
gets
you
in
the
door
Then
after
a
test
drive
when
it's
time
to
look
at
numbers
they
want
go
back
now
irrelevant
msrp
negotiate
from
there
Additionally
charge
for
dealer
accessories"...which
other
dealers
do
window
tint
nitrogen
400
So
then
by
this
point
out
door
10k
above
THEY
advertise
their
sales
as
Get
of
here
with
that
crap
You
except
few
grand
tax
fees
etc
but
certainly
not
10
an
SUV
price
We
don't
play
games
like
this--there
are
more
honest
either
so
why
would
we
give
our
business
place
this
Additionally
were
looking
brand
new
car
only
40
miles
it
looks
been
neglected
just
sitting

Filthy
exterior
even
under

I

Great
experience
to

a

Buffett
in
Las

This
is
one
of
my
sons
favorite
eateries
As
for
me
it's
multi
national
food
emporium
that
includes
Asian
Latino
Italian
American
and
seafoods
carving
stations
Of
course
help
yourself
place
s
very
cafeteria
style
They
also
bar
where
house
wines
tap
beer
are
included
but
you
can
get
mixer
if
want
the
extra
charge
I
was
impressed
with
quality

choices
each
section
had
its

Food
was
very

pretentious
to
the
point
of
being

Price

Thank
you
thank
K

for
introducing
me
to
this
magnificent
Mediterranean
restaurant
It's
here
in
Henderson
on

Coronado
I
don't
care
what
part
of

live
it's
worth
the
drive
here
Besides
being
clean

You

Messaged

about

They
responded
with
a
few
additional
questions
to
which
I
answered
No

If

One

Happy
new

I
originally
heard
of
this
place
when
received
a
living
social
deal
for
Christmas
Around
Valentine's
Day
found
Groupon
couples
massage
which
my
boyfriend
and
used
about
month
later

that

therapist
was
rushing
through
left
over
5
minutes
during
session
to
use
the
restroom
while
continuing
be
relaxed
by
his
thorough
therapist
The
experience
itself
wasn't
one
where
we
were
eager
return
but
not
bad
enough
return
Since
had
yet
redeemed
original
gift

tried
book
an
appointment
using

as

woman
who
speaking
with
I

informed
me
since
been
there
before
would
have

My
question
her
was
how
person

supposed

She
said

their

myself

will

Just

Have
used
them

in

they
are

Tip
On

Also
get

your

Do
it

its

Spectacular
My

Would
recommend
to
anyone
I
went
to
Smok'n
Hot
on
a
whim
i
saw
it
while
was
leaving
from
trip
the
local
Walmart
and
decided
stop
in
look
around
Boy
Am
happy
did
The
store
is
beautiful
young
lady
who
worked
there
FANTASTIC
She
very

Really
knew
her

had
found

she
actually
made

Being

It's

can't

good

about
this
store
it
The
margaritas
are
good
and
priced
right
if
you
go
during
happy
hour
food
however
is
awful
Nothing
here
remotely
authentic
and
compared
to
the
great
places
like
Los
Gemelos
Tacqueria
Guadalajara
Francisco's
Cantina
this
place
has
nothing
on
any
of
them
Frida's
can
be
summed
up
with
two
words
overpriced
mediocre
Love
this
place
Had
the
almond
crusted
snapper
for
lunch
It
was
absolute
best
fish
I
have
ever
had
We
also
had
Greek
Salad
Calamari
and
a
pasta
dish
Everything
delicious
Pro
Edge
is
the
best
boxing
gym
in
valley
The
trainers
have
years
of
experience
I
been
with
for
awhile
and
they
nothing
short
amazing
There
every
type
boxers
at
from
beginner
to
pro
lots
fitness
oriented
women
that
love
it
also
It
not

been
a

I
take

as

joint
But
not
overly
to

Enjoyed
the

The
Memphis

only
dish
didn't

was

Arby's

Recently
after
experiencing
transmission
trouble
with
my
1996
LT1
Corvette
a
call
to
MCR
Corvette's
turned
out
be
non-other
than
total
godsend
Essentially
the
3-4
clutch
pack
in
4l60e
busted
very
common
on
these
cars
while
highway
rendering
3rd
and
4th
gear
useless
After
calling
around
multiple
shops
I
was
continually
quoted
an
astronomical
price
for
complete
overhaul/replacement
Feeling
rather
hopeless
stumbled
across
doing
web
search
decided
give
them
call
Willy
the
owner
assume
assured
me
that
what
actually
extremely
problem
among
corvettes
Moreover
he
mentioned
when
something
of
this
nature
does
goes
wrong
it
may
not
wise
jump
full
replacement
as
there
is
typically
single
part
3-4
clutch
fails
otherwise
strong
transmission
had
fixed
cars
by
simply
replacing
faulty
a
significantly
less
costly
option
Following
his
advice
dropped
off
car
at
within
three
days
completely
restored
very
reasonable
price
What
sold
level
honesty
encountered
These
gentleman
will
tell
you
exactly
wrong
your
corvette
try
sell
any
unnecessary
service
Being
open
over
40
years
MCR
who
specialize
solely
corvettes
know
every
nut
bolt
way
no
other
mechanic
city
can
compare
to
Any
Las
Vegas
would
fool
overlook
their
expertise
take
elsewhere
Lastly
have
say
running
stronger
ever
service
noticeable
increase
performance
efficiency
CHOOSE
Love
their
lemon
custard
We
were
looking
for
custard
ice
cream
and
decided
to
give
this
a
try
Yummy
yummy
yummy
Food
tastes
very
good
But
the
last
three
times
I
went
had
diarrhea
every
time
It's
sad
that
it
took
me
to
remember
can't
go
back
anymore
Last
night
my
husband
same
problem
don't
know
why
Something
is
not
sanitary
there
Hmmm
where
do
I
start
Desserts
are
freakin
awesome
Give
this
place
a
try
well
